SceneMaker: Open-set 3D Scene Generation with Decoupled De-occlusion and Pose Estimation Model,"We propose a decoupled 3D scene generation framework called SceneMaker in this work. Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes. Our codes and datasets is released at https://idea-research.github.io/SceneMaker/.",2025-12-11 18:59:56+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10957v1
Hierarchical Dataset Selection for High-Quality Data Sharing,"The success of modern machine learning hinges on access to high-quality training data. In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps. Ablations show DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows.",2025-12-11 18:59:55+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10952v1
Are We Ready for RL in Text-to-3D Generation? A Progressive Investigation,"Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation.

ImplicitRDP: An End-to-End Visual-Force Diffusion Policy with Structural Slow-Fast Learning,"Human-level contact-rich manipulation relies on the distinct roles of two key modalities: vision provides spatially rich but temporally slow global context, while force sensing captures rapid, high-frequency local contact dynamics. Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end visual-force diffusion policy that integrates visual planning and reactive force control within a single network. We introduce Structural Slow-Fast Learning, a mechanism utilizing causal attention to simultaneously process asynchronous visual and force tokens, allowing the policy to perform closed-loop adjustments at the force frequency while maintaining the temporal coherence of action chunks. Furthermore, to mitigate modality collapse where end-to-end models fail to adjust the weights across different modalities, we propose Virtual-target-based Representation Regularization. This auxiliary objective maps force feedback into the same space as the action, providing a stronger, physics-grounded learning signal than raw force prediction. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that ImplicitRDP significantly outperforms both vision-only and hierarchical baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates with a streamlined training pipeline.

AlcheMinT: Fine-grained Temporal Control for Multi-Reference Consistent Video Generation,"Recent advances in subject-driven video generation with large diffusion models have enabled personalized content synthesis conditioned on user-provided subjects. However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

Mull-Tokens: Modality-Agnostic Latent Thinking,"Reasoning goes beyond language; the real world requires reasoning about space, time, affordances, and much more that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline. Adding to conversations around challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning, Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities.",2025-12-11 18:59:08+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10941v1
OmniView: An All-Seeing Diffusion Model for 3D and 4D View Synthesis,"Prior approaches injecting camera control into diffusion models have focused on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks: novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video, amongst others. Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation. With strong generalizability in one model, OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model.

Stronger Normalization-Free Transformers,"Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.",2025-12-11 18:58:49+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.CV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10938v1
On Decision-Making Agents and Higher-Order Causal Processes,"We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.",2025-12-11 18:58:33+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'quant-ph']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10937v1
Empirical evaluation of the Frank-Wolfe methods for constructing white-box adversarial attacks,"The construction of adversarial attacks for neural networks appears to be a crucial challenge for their deployment in various services. To estimate the adversarial robustness of a neural network, a fast and efficient approach is needed to construct adversarial attacks. Since the formalization of adversarial attack construction involves solving a specific optimization problem, we consider the problem of constructing an efficient and effective adversarial attack from a numerical optimization perspective. Specifically, we suggest utilizing advanced projection-free methods, known as modified Frank-Wolfe methods, to construct white-box adversarial attacks on the given input data. We perform a theoretical and numerical evaluation of these methods and compare them with standard approaches based on projection operations or geometrical intuition. Numerical experiments are performed on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, utilizing a multiclass logistic regression model, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the Vision Transformer (ViT).",2025-12-11 18:58:17+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10936v1
Any4D: Unified Feed-Forward Metric 4D Reconstruction,"We present Any4D, a scalable multi-view transformer for metric-scale, dense feed-forward 4D reconstruction. Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking. Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates. We achieve superior performance across diverse setups - both in terms of accuracy (2-3X lower error) and compute efficiency (15X faster), opening avenues for multiple downstream applications.",2025-12-11 18:57:39+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10935v1
Curriculum-Based Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous UAV Navigation in Unknown Curved Tubular Conduit,"Autonomous drone navigation in confined tubular environments remains a major challenge due to the constraining geometry of the conduits, the proximity of the walls, and the perceptual limitations inherent to such scenarios. We propose a reinforcement learning approach enabling a drone to navigate unknown three-dimensional tubes without any prior knowledge of their geometry, relying solely on local observations from LiDAR and a conditional visual detection of the tube center. In contrast, the Pure Pursuit algorithm, used as a deterministic baseline, benefits from explicit access to the centerline, creating an information asymmetry designed to assess the ability of RL to compensate for the absence of a geometric model. The agent is trained through a progressive Curriculum Learning strategy that gradually exposes it to increasingly curved geometries, where the tube center frequently disappears from the visual field. A turning-negotiation mechanism, based on the combination of direct visibility, directional memory, and LiDAR symmetry cues, proves essential for ensuring stable navigation under such partial observability conditions. Experiments show that the PPO policy acquires robust and generalizable behavior, consistently outperforming the deterministic controller despite its limited access to geometric information. Validation in a high-fidelity 3D environment further confirms the transferability of the learned behavior to a continuous physical dynamics.
  The proposed approach thus provides a complete framework for autonomous navigation in unknown tubular environments and opens perspectives for industrial, underground, or medical applications where progressing through narrow and weakly perceptive conduits represents a central challenge.",2025-12-11 18:57:29+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10934v1
BabyVLM-V2: Toward Developmentally Grounded Pretraining and Benchmarking of Vision Foundation Models,"Early children's developmental trajectories set up a natural goal for sample-efficient pretraining of vision foundation models. We introduce BabyVLM-V2, a developmentally grounded framework for infant-inspired vision-language modeling that extensively improves upon BabyVLM-V1 through a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set, a versatile model, and, most importantly, DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation. The pretraining set maximizes coverage while minimizing curation of a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus, yielding video-utterance, image-utterance, and multi-turn conversational data that mirror infant experiences. DevCV Toolbox adapts all vision-related measures of the recently released NIH Baby Toolbox into a benchmark suite of ten multimodal tasks, covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding aligned with early children's capabilities. Experimental results show that a compact model pretrained from scratch can achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks. We hope the principled, unified BabyVLM-V2 framework will accelerate research in developmentally plausible pretraining of vision foundation models.",2025-12-11 18:57:05+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10932v1
Decoupled Q-Chunking,"Temporal-difference (TD) methods learn state and action values efficiently by bootstrapping from their own future value predictions, but such a self-bootstrapping mechanism is prone to bootstrapping bias, where the errors in the value targets accumulate across steps and result in biased value estimates. Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (""chunks"") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods.

Digital Twin Supervised Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Underwater Navigation,"Autonomous navigation in underwater environments remains a major challenge due to the absence of GPS, degraded visibility, and the presence of submerged obstacles. This article investigates these issues through the case of the BlueROV2, an open platform widely used for scientific experimentation. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, using an observation space that combines target-oriented navigation information, a virtual occupancy grid, and ray-casting along the boundaries of the operational area. The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the transferability of the learned behavior from simulation to the real world, confirming the relevance of deep RL for autonomous navigation in underwater robotics.",2025-12-11 18:52:42+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10925v1
SparseSwaps: Tractable LLM Pruning Mask Refinement at Scale,"The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.",2025-12-11 18:47:48+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10922v1
Multi-Granular Node Pruning for Circuit Discovery,"Circuit discovery aims to identify minimal subnetworks that are responsible for specific behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches primarily rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units such as attention heads or MLP blocks, overlooking finer structures like individual neurons. We propose a node-level pruning framework for circuit discovery that addresses both scalability and granularity limitations. Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance. Furthermore, our method has a significantly lower memory footprint, 5-10x, as it does not require keeping intermediate activations in the memory to work.",2025-12-11 18:32:15+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10903v1
LLMs Can Assist with Proposal Selection at Large User Facilities,"We explore how large language models (LLMs) can enhance the proposal selection process at large user facilities, offering a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective alternative to traditional human review. Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $ρ\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\geq 0.5$ after 10\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.",2025-12-11 18:23:56+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10895v1
Iterative Compositional Data Generation for Robot Control,"Collecting robotic manipulation data is expensive, making it impractical to acquire demonstrations for the combinatorially large space of tasks that arise in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment settings. While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.",2025-12-11 18:20:49+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10891v1

We evaluate Linear, NLinear, DLinear, Transformer, Informer, and Autoformer under standardized train, validation, and test splits. Results show that linear baselines (Linear, NLinear, DLinear) consistently outperform more complex Transformer-family architectures, with DLinear achieving the best overall accuracy across all splits. These findings highlight that carefully designed linear models remain strong baselines for time series forecasting in challenging exogenous-only settings.",2025-12-11 17:59:44+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10866v1
MMSI-Video-Bench: A Holistic Benchmark for Video-Based Spatial Intelligence,"Spatial understanding over continuous visual input is crucial for MLLMs to evolve into general-purpose assistants in physical environments. Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence.",2025-12-11 17:57:24+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10863v1
Generative Modeling from Black-box Corruptions via Self-Consistent Stochastic Interpolants,"Transport-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for building generative models from large, clean datasets. However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate superior performance on inverse problems in natural image processing and scientific reconstruction, and establish convergence guarantees of the scheme under appropriate assumptions.",2025-12-11 17:53:38+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10857v1
V-OCBF: Learning Safety Filters from Offline Data via Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions,"Ensuring safety in autonomous systems requires controllers that satisfy hard, state-wise constraints without relying on online interaction. While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.",2025-12-11 17:14:37+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10822v1
Agile Deliberation: Concept Deliberation for Subjective Visual Classification,"From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through ""concept deliberation"", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called ""Agile Deliberation"" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.",2025-12-11 17:13:09+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'cs.HC', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10821v1
Extrapolation of Periodic Functions Using Binary Encoding of Continuous Numerical Values,"We report the discovery that binary encoding allows neural networks to extrapolate periodic functions beyond their training bounds.

Internal activation analysis reveals that NB2E induces bit-phase representations, enabling MLPs to learn and extrapolate signal structure independently of position.",2025-12-11 17:08:28+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'stat.ML']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10817v1
HAROOD: A Benchmark for Out-of-distribution Generalization in Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition,"Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR. Our implementation is released and can be found at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/HAROOD.",2025-12-11 16:52:50+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10807v1
What matters for Representation Alignment: Global Information or Spatial Structure?,"Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

LabelFusion: Learning to Fuse LLMs and Transformer Classifiers for Robust Text Classification,"LabelFusion is a fusion ensemble for text classification that learns to combine a traditional transformer-based classifier (e.g., RoBERTa) with one or more Large Language Models (LLMs such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek) to deliver accurate and cost-aware predictions across multi-class and multi-label tasks. The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.",2025-12-11 16:39:07+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10793v1
The FACTS Leaderboard: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Model Factuality,"We introduce The FACTS Leaderboard, an online leaderboard suite and associated set of benchmarks that comprehensively evaluates the ability of language models to generate factually accurate text across diverse scenarios. The suite provides a holistic measure of factuality by aggregating the performance of models on four distinct sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal, which measures the factuality of responses to image-based questions; (2) FACTS Parametric, which assesses models' world knowledge by answering closed-book factoid questions from internal parameters; (3) FACTS Search, which evaluates factuality in information-seeking scenarios, where the model must use a search API; and (4) FACTS Grounding (v2), which evaluates whether long-form responses are grounded in provided documents, featuring significantly improved judge models. Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality. The FACTS Leaderboard Suite will be actively maintained, containing both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding its integrity.

Natural Language Interface for Firewall Configuration,"This paper presents the design and prototype implementation of a natural language interface for configuring enterprise firewalls. The framework allows administrators to express access control policies in plain language, which are then translated into vendor specific configurations. A compact schema bound intermediate representation separates human intent from device syntax and in the current prototype compiles to Palo Alto PAN OS command line configuration while remaining extensible to other platforms. Large language models are used only as assistive parsers that generate typed intermediate representation objects, while compilation and enforcement remain deterministic. The prototype integrates three validation layers, namely a static linter that checks structural and vendor specific constraints, a safety gate that blocks overly permissive rules such as any to any allows, and a Batfish based simulator that validates configuration syntax and referential integrity against a synthetic device model. The paper describes the architecture, implementation, and test methodology on synthetic network context datasets and discusses how this approach can evolve into a scalable auditable and human centered workflow for firewall policy management.",2025-12-11 16:33:33+00:00,"['cs.NI', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10789v1
"Replace, Don't Expand: Mitigating Context Dilution in Multi-Hop RAG via Fixed-Budget Evidence Assembly","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth.

Developing and Evaluating a Large Language Model-Based Automated Feedback System Grounded in Evidence-Centered Design for Supporting Physics Problem Solving,"Generative AI offers new opportunities for individualized and adaptive learning, particularly through large language model (LLM)-based feedback systems. While LLMs can produce effective feedback for relatively straightforward conceptual tasks, delivering high-quality feedback for tasks that require advanced domain expertise, such as physics problem solving, remains a substantial challenge. This study presents the design of an LLM-based feedback system for physics problem solving grounded in evidence-centered design (ECD) and evaluates its performance within the German Physics Olympiad. Participants assessed the usefulness and accuracy of the generated feedback, which was generally perceived as useful and highly accurate. However, an in-depth analysis revealed that the feedback contained factual errors in 20% of cases; errors that often went unnoticed by the students. We discuss the risks associated with uncritical reliance on LLM-based feedback systems and outline potential directions for generating more adaptive and reliable LLM-based feedback in the future.",2025-12-11 16:29:38+00:00,"['physics.ed-ph', 'cs.AI', 'cs.HC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10785v1
AERMANI-Diffusion: Regime-Conditioned Diffusion for Dynamics Learning in Aerial Manipulators,"Aerial manipulators undergo rapid, configuration-dependent changes in inertial coupling forces and aerodynamic forces, making accurate dynamics modeling a core challenge for reliable control. Analytical models lose fidelity under these nonlinear and nonstationary effects, while standard data-driven methods such as deep neural networks and Gaussian processes cannot represent the diverse residual behaviors that arise across different operating conditions. We propose a regime-conditioned diffusion framework that models the full distribution of residual forces using a conditional diffusion process and a lightweight temporal encoder. The encoder extracts a compact summary of recent motion and configuration, enabling consistent residual predictions even through abrupt transitions or unseen payloads. When combined with an adaptive controller, the framework enables dynamics uncertainty compensation and yields markedly improved tracking accuracy in real-world tests.",2025-12-11 16:10:32+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10773v1
Grow Up and Merge: Scaling Strategies for Efficient Language Adaptation,"Achieving high-performing language models which include medium- and lower-resource languages remains a challenge. Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration.",2025-12-11 16:09:54+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10772v1
Designing AI-Resilient Assessments Using Interconnected Problems: A Theoretically Grounded and Empirically Validated Framework,"The rapid adoption of generative AI has undermined traditional modular assessments in computing education, creating a disconnect between academic evaluation and industry practice. This paper presents a theoretically grounded framework for designing AI-resilient assessments, supported by formal analysis and multi-year empirical validation.
  We make three contributions. First, we establish two theoretical results: (1) assessments composed of interconnected problems, where outputs feed into subsequent stages, are more AI-resilient than modular assessments because current language models struggle with sustained multi-step reasoning and context; and (2) semi-structured problems with deterministic success criteria provide more reliable measures of student competency than fully open-ended projects, which allow AI systems to default to familiar solution patterns. These results challenge common policy and institutional guidance that promotes open-ended assessments as the primary safeguard for academic integrity.
  Second, we validate these results using data from four university data science courses (N = 138). While students achieve near-perfect scores on AI-assisted modular homework, performance drops by roughly 30 percentage points on proctored exams, indicating substantial AI score inflation. Interconnected projects remain strongly correlated with modular assessments, suggesting they measure the same underlying skills while resisting AI misuse. Proctored exams show weaker alignment, implying they may assess test-taking ability rather than intended learning outcomes.
  Third, we translate these findings into a practical assessment design framework. The proposed approach enables educators to create assessments that promote integrative thinking, reflect real-world AI-augmented workflows, and naturally resist trivial delegation to generative AI, thereby helping restore academic integrity.",2025-12-11 15:53:19+00:00,"['cs.CY', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10758v1
Long-horizon Reasoning Agent for Olympiad-Level Mathematical Problem Solving,"Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{O}utcome-based \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \textsc{\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2\% to 73.3\% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales.",2025-12-11 15:26:28+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10739v1
Distribution-Free Stochastic MPC for Joint-in-Time Chance-Constrained Linear Systems,"This work presents a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) framework for linear systems subject to joint-in-time chance constraints under unknown disturbance distributions. Unlike existing stochastic MPC formulations that rely on parametric or Gaussian assumptions or require expensive offline computations, the proposed method leverages conformal prediction (CP) as a streamlined tool to construct finite-sample confidence regions for the system's stochastic error trajectories with minimal computational effort. These regions enable the relaxation of probabilistic constraints while providing formal guarantees. By employing an indirect feedback mechanism and a probabilistic set-based formulation, we prove recursive feasibility of the relaxed optimization problem and establish chance constraint satisfaction in closed-loop. Furthermore, we extend the approach to the more general output feedback setting with unknown measurement noise distributions. Given available noise samples, we establish satisfaction of the joint chance constraints and recursive feasibility via output measurements alone. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.",2025-12-11 15:25:02+00:00,"['eess.SY', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10738v1
LGAN: An Efficient High-Order Graph Neural Network via the Line Graph Aggregation,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for graph classification. Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability.",2025-12-11 15:23:46+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10735v1
Textual Data Bias Detection and Mitigation - An Extensible Pipeline with Experimental Evaluation,"Textual data used to train large language models (LLMs) exhibits multifaceted bias manifestations encompassing harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.",2025-12-11 15:18:59+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10734v1
PACIFIC: a framework for generating benchmarks to check Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code,"Large Language Model (LLM)-based code assistants have emerged as a powerful application of generative AI, demonstrating impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension. A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models. Overall, our framework offers a scalable, contamination-resilient methodology for assessing core competencies of LLMs in code-related tasks.",2025-12-11 14:49:56+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10713v1
COMPARE: Clinical Optimization with Modular Planning and Assessment via RAG-Enhanced AI-OCT: Superior Decision Support for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Compared to ChatGPT-5 and Junior Operators,"Background: While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.
  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.
  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.
  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.",2025-12-11 14:41:37+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10702v1
On the Stabilization of Rigid Formations on Regular Curves,"This work deals with the problem of stabilizing a multi-agent rigid formation on a general class of planar curves. Namely, we seek to stabilize an equilateral polygonal formation on closed planar differentiable curves after a path sweep. The task of finding an inscribed regular polygon centered at the point of interest is solved via a randomized multi-start Newton-Like algorithm for which one is able to ascertain the existence of a minimizer. Then we design a continuous feedback law that guarantees convergence to, and sufficient sweeping of the curve, followed by convergence to the desired formation vertices while ensuring inter-agent avoidance. The proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations for different classes of curves and different rigid formations.

How to Brake? Ethical Emergency Braking with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to enhance driving safety, for example by enabling safe vehicle following and more efficient traffic scheduling. For such future deployments, safety requirements should be addressed, where the primary such are avoidance of vehicle collisions and substantial mitigating of harm when collisions are unavoidable. However, conservative worst-case-based control strategies come at the price of reduced flexibility and may compromise overall performance. In light of this, we investigate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can be leveraged to improve safety in multi-vehicle-following scenarios involving emergency braking. Specifically, we investigate how DRL with vehicle-to-vehicle communication can be used to ethically select an emergency breaking profile in scenarios where overall, or collective, three-vehicle harm reduction or collision avoidance shall be obtained instead of single-vehicle such. As an algorithm, we provide a hybrid approach that combines DRL with a previously published method based on analytical expressions for selecting optimal constant deceleration. By combining DRL with the previous method, the proposed hybrid approach increases the reliability compared to standalone DRL, while achieving superior performance in terms of overall harm reduction and collision avoidance.",2025-12-11 14:40:33+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10698v1
"Remember Me, Refine Me: A Dynamic Procedural Memory Framework for Experience-Driven Agent Evolution","Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize ""how-to"" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a ""passive accumulation"" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning.

Enhancing Radiology Report Generation and Visual Grounding using Reinforcement Learning,"Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning (""thinking"") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.",2025-12-11 14:36:14+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10691v1
Rethinking Popularity Bias in Collaborative Filtering via Analytical Vector Decomposition,"Popularity bias fundamentally undermines the personalization capabilities of collaborative filtering (CF) models, causing them to disproportionately recommend popular items while neglecting users' genuine preferences for niche content. While existing approaches treat this as an external confounding factor, we reveal that popularity bias is an intrinsic geometric artifact of Bayesian Pairwise Ranking (BPR) optimization in CF models. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that BPR systematically organizes item embeddings along a dominant ""popularity direction"" where embedding magnitudes directly correlate with interaction frequency. This geometric distortion forces user embeddings to simultaneously handle two conflicting tasks-expressing genuine preference and calibrating against global popularity-trapping them in suboptimal configurations that favor popular items regardless of individual tastes. We propose Directional Decomposition and Correction (DDC), a universally applicable framework that surgically corrects this embedding geometry through asymmetric directional updates. DDC guides positive interactions along personalized preference directions while steering negative interactions away from the global popularity direction, disentangling preference from popularity at the geometric source. Extensive experiments across multiple BPR-based architectures demonstrate that DDC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art debiasing methods, reducing training loss to less than 5% of heavily-tuned baselines while achieving superior recommendation quality and fairness.

Challenges of Evaluating LLM Safety for User Welfare,"Safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) typically focus on universal risks like dangerous capabilities or undesirable propensities. However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments.",2025-12-11 14:34:40+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10687v1
Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator,"Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.",2025-12-11 14:22:14+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10675v1
AEBNAS: Strengthening Exit Branches in Early-Exit Networks through Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search,"Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",2025-12-11 14:17:49+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10671v1
On the Dynamics of Multi-Agent LLM Communities Driven by Value Diversity,"As Large Language Models (LLM) based multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the collective behaviors, e.g., collective intelligence, of such artificial communities have drawn growing attention. This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability. This work positions value diversity as a new axis of future AI capability, bridging AI ability and sociological studies of institutional emergence.",2025-12-11 14:13:53+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10665v1
CAPTAIN: Semantic Feature Injection for Memorization Mitigation in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are increasingly deployed at scale. Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.",2025-12-11 14:01:47+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10655v1
Refinement Contrastive Learning of Cell-Gene Associations for Unsupervised Cell Type Identification,"Unsupervised cell type identification is crucial for uncovering and characterizing heterogeneous populations in single cell omics studies. Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

Unified Smart Factory Model: A model-based Approach for Integrating Industry 4.0 and Sustainability for Manufacturing Systems,"This paper presents the Unified Smart Factory Model (USFM), a comprehensive framework designed to translate high-level sustainability goals into measurable factory-level indicators with a systematic information map of manufacturing activities. The manufacturing activities were modelled as set of manufacturing, assembly and auxiliary processes using Object Process Methodology, a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) language. USFM integrates Manufacturing Process and System, Data Process, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Selection and Assessment in a single framework. Through a detailed case study of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly factory, the paper demonstrates how environmental sustainability KPIs can be selected, modelled, and mapped to the necessary data, highlighting energy consumption and environmental impact metrics. The model's systematic approach can reduce redundancy, minimize the risk of missing critical information, and enhance data collection. The paper concluded that the USFM bridges the gap between sustainability goals and practical implementation, providing significant benefits for industries specifically SMEs aiming to achieve sustainability targets.",2025-12-11 13:30:38+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10631v1
Phythesis: Physics-Guided Evolutionary Scene Synthesis for Energy-Efficient Data Center Design via LLMs,"Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.",2025-12-11 13:04:44+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.NE']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10611v1
LEO-RobotAgent: A General-purpose Robotic Agent for Language-driven Embodied Operator,"We propose LEO-RobotAgent, a general-purpose language-driven intelligent agent framework for robots. Under this framework, LLMs can operate different types of robots to complete unpredictable complex tasks across various scenarios. This framework features strong generalization, robustness, and efficiency. The application-level system built around it can fully enhance bidirectional human-robot intent understanding and lower the threshold for human-robot interaction. Regarding robot task planning, the vast majority of existing studies focus on the application of large models in single-task scenarios and for single robot types. These algorithms often have complex structures and lack generalizability. Thus, the proposed LEO-RobotAgent framework is designed with a streamlined structure as much as possible, enabling large models to independently think, plan, and act within this clear framework. We provide a modular and easily registrable toolset, allowing large models to flexibly call various tools to meet different requirements. Meanwhile, the framework incorporates a human-robot interaction mechanism, enabling the algorithm to collaborate with humans like a partner. Experiments have verified that this framework can be easily adapted to mainstream robot platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotic arms, and wheeled robot, and efficiently execute a variety of carefully designed tasks with different complexity levels.

"Beyond Pixels: A Training-Free, Text-to-Text Framework for Remote Sensing Image Retrieval","Semantic retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images is a critical task fundamentally challenged by the \textquote{semantic gap}, the discrepancy between a model's low-level visual features and high-level human concepts. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.",2025-12-11 12:43:41+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10596v1
Motion Planning for Safe Landing of a Human-Piloted Parafoil,"Most skydiving accidents occur during the parafoil-piloting and landing stages and result from human lapses in judgment while piloting the parafoil. Training of novice pilots is protracted due to the lack of functional and easily accessible training simulators. Moreover, work on parafoil trajectory planning suitable for aiding human training remains limited. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of computing safe trajectories for human-piloted parafoil flight and examine how such trajectories fare against human-generated solutions. For the algorithmic part, we adapt the sampling-based motion planner Stable Sparse RRT (SST) by Li et al., to cope with the problem constraints while minimizing the bank angle (control effort) as a proxy for safety. We then compare the computer-generated solutions with data from human-generated parafoil flight, where the algorithm offers a relative cost improvement of 20\%-80\% over the performance of the human pilot. We observe that human pilots tend to, first, close the horizontal distance to the landing area, and then address the vertical gap by spiraling down to the suitable altitude for starting a landing maneuver. The algorithm considered here makes smoother and more gradual descents, arriving at the landing area at the precise altitude necessary for the final approach while maintaining safety constraints. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of computer-generated guidelines, rather than traditional rules of thumb, which can be integrated into future simulators to train pilots for safer and more cost-effective flights.",2025-12-11 12:39:48+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10595v1
NormCode: A Semi-Formal Language for Context-Isolated AI Planning,"Multistep workflows that chain large language model (LLM) calls suffer from context pollution: as information accumulates across steps, models hallucinate, confuse intermediate outputs, and lose track of task constraints. We present NormCode, a semiformal language for constructing plans of inferences, structured decompositions where each step operates in data isolation and receives only explicitly passed inputs, which eliminates crossstep contamination by design. NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing. The language exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification, supporting progressive formalization from sketch to production. We validate NormCode through two demonstrations: (1) a base X addition algorithm achieving 100 percent accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self hosted execution of NormCode's own five phase compiler pipeline. The working orchestrator provides dependency driven scheduling, SQLite backed checkpointing, and loop management, making AI workflows auditable by design and addressing a critical need for transparency in high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis.",2025-12-11 11:50:50+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10563v1
LLM-Auction: Generative Auction towards LLM-Native Advertising,"The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates novel monetization strategies, among which LLM-native advertising has emerged as a promising paradigm by naturally integrating advertisement within LLM-generated responses. However, this paradigm fundamentally shifts the auction object from discrete ad slots to the distribution over LLM outputs, posing new challenges for designing auction mechanisms. Existing mechanisms for LLM-native advertising adopt frameworks that decouple auction and generation, which either ignore externalities or require multiple LLM inferences for ad allocation, rendering them impractical for industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Auction, which to the best of our knowledge is the first learning-based generative auction mechanism that integrates auction and LLM generation for LLM-native advertising. By formulating the allocation optimization as a preference alignment problem between LLM outputs and the mechanism's objective which reflects both advertisers' expected value and user experience, we introduce Iterative Reward-Preference Optimization (IRPO) algorithm that alternately optimizes the reward model and the LLM. This approach enables the LLM to inherently model allocation externalities without any extra inference cost. We further identify the allocation monotonicity and continuity of LLM-Auction, which allows us to prove that a simple first-price payment rule exhibits favorable incentive properties. Additionally, we design an LLM-as-a-judge simulation environment to facilitate large-scale data construction and enable comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the mechanism's performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LLM-Auction significantly outperforms existing baselines in allocation efficiency, while achieving the desired mechanism properties.",2025-12-11 11:31:20+00:00,"['cs.GT', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10551v1
Mr. Virgil: Learning Multi-robot Visual-range Relative Localization,"Ultra-wideband (UWB)-vision fusion localization has achieved extensive applications in the domain of multi-agent relative localization. The challenging matching problem between robots and visual detection renders existing methods highly dependent on identity-encoded hardware or delicate tuning algorithms. Overconfident yet erroneous matches may bring about irreversible damage to the localization system. To address this issue, we introduce Mr. Virgil, an end-to-end learning multi-robot visual-range relative localization framework, consisting of a graph neural network for data association between UWB rangings and visual detections, and a differentiable pose graph optimization (PGO) back-end. The graph-based front-end supplies robust matching results, accurate initial position predictions, and credible uncertainty estimates, which are subsequently integrated into the PGO back-end to elevate the accuracy of the final pose estimation. Additionally, a decentralized system is implemented for real-world applications. Experiments spanning varying robot numbers, simulation and real-world, occlusion and non-occlusion conditions showcase the stability and exactitude under various scenes compared to conventional methods.

Achieving Olympia-Level Geometry Large Language Model Agent via Complexity Boosting Reinforcement Learning,"Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.",2025-12-11 11:05:04+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10534v1
Neural Ranging Inertial Odometry,"Ultra-wideband (UWB) has shown promising potential in GPS-denied localization thanks to its lightweight and drift-free characteristics, while the accuracy is limited in real scenarios due to its sensitivity to sensor arrangement and non-Gaussian pattern induced by multi-path or multi-signal interference, which commonly occurs in many typical applications like long tunnels. We introduce a novel neural fusion framework for ranging inertial odometry which involves a graph attention UWB network and a recurrent neural inertial network. Our graph net learns scene-relevant ranging patterns and adapts to any number of anchors or tags, realizing accurate positioning without calibration. Additionally, the integration of least squares and the incorporation of nominal frame enhance overall performance and scalability. The effectiveness and robustness of our methods are validated through extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets, spanning indoor, outdoor, and tunnel environments. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed IR-ULSG in handling challenging conditions, including scenarios outside the convex envelope and cases where only a single anchor is available.",2025-12-11 11:03:26+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10531v1
Adaptive Replay Buffer for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning,"Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL) faces a critical dilemma in balancing the use of a fixed offline dataset with newly collected online experiences. Standard methods, often relying on a fixed data-mixing ratio, struggle to manage the trade-off between early learning stability and asymptotic performance. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences. Our extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that ARB consistently mitigates early performance degradation and significantly improves the final performance of various O2O RL algorithms, highlighting the importance of an adaptive, behavior-aware replay buffer design.",2025-12-11 10:30:04+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10510v1
Zero-shot 3D Map Generation with LLM Agents: A Dual-Agent Architecture for Procedural Content Generation,"Procedural Content Generation (PCG) offers scalable methods for algorithmically creating complex, customizable worlds. However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.",2025-12-11 10:22:02+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10501v1
UACER: An Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble Framework for Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning,"Robust adversarial reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training agents to handle uncertain disturbance in real environments, with critical applications in sequential decision-making domains such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency.",2025-12-11 10:14:13+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10492v1
Contact SLAM: An Active Tactile Exploration Policy Based on Physical Reasoning Utilized in Robotic Fine Blind Manipulation Tasks,"Contact-rich manipulation is difficult for robots to execute and requires accurate perception of the environment. In some scenarios, vision is occluded. The robot can then no longer obtain real-time scene state information through visual feedback. This is called ``blind manipulation"". In this manuscript, a novel physically-driven contact cognition method, called ``Contact SLAM"", is proposed. It estimates the state of the environment and achieves manipulation using only tactile sensing and prior knowledge of the scene. To maximize exploration efficiency, this manuscript also designs an active exploration policy. The policy gradually reduces uncertainties in the manipulation scene. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in several contact-rich tasks, including the difficult and delicate socket assembly task and block-pushing task.",2025-12-11 09:59:08+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10481v1
"Seamless Outdoor-Indoor Pedestrian Positioning System with GNSS/UWB/IMU Fusion: A Comparison of EKF, FGO, and PF","Accurate and continuous pedestrian positioning across outdoor-indoor environments remains challenging because GNSS, UWB, and inertial PDR are complementary yet individually fragile under signal blockage, multipath, and drift. This paper presents a unified GNSS/UWB/IMU fusion framework for seamless pedestrian localization and provides a controlled comparison of three probabilistic back-ends: an error-state extended Kalman filter, sliding-window factor graph optimization, and a particle filter. The system uses chest-mounted IMU-based PDR as the motion backbone and integrates absolute updates from GNSS outdoors and UWB indoors. To enhance transition robustness and mitigate urban GNSS degradation, we introduce a lightweight map-based feasibility constraint derived from OpenStreetMap building footprints, treating most building interiors as non-navigable while allowing motion inside a designated UWB-instrumented building. The framework is implemented in ROS 2 and runs in real time on a wearable platform, with visualization in Foxglove. We evaluate three scenarios: indoor (UWB+PDR), outdoor (GNSS+PDR), and seamless outdoor-indoor (GNSS+UWB+PDR). Results show that the ESKF provides the most consistent overall performance in our implementation.",2025-12-11 09:59:03+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10480v1
Symphony: A Heuristic Normalized Calibrated Advantage Actor and Critic Algorithm in application for Humanoid Robots,"In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. ""Swaddling"" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.",2025-12-11 09:55:49+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.NE']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10477v1
T-SKM-Net: Trainable Neural Network Framework for Linear Constraint Satisfaction via Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Method,"Neural network constraint satisfaction is crucial for safety-critical applications such as power system optimization, robotic path planning, and autonomous driving. However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance.",2025-12-11 09:35:13+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'math.OC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10461v1
When Reject Turns into Accept: Quantifying the Vulnerability of LLM-Based Scientific Reviewers to Indirect Prompt Injection,"The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the ""Lazy Reviewer"" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these ""LLM-as-a-Judge"" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping ""Reject"" decisions to ""Accept,"" for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like ""Maximum Mark Magyk"" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models.

Maximum Risk Minimization with Random Forests,"We consider a regression setting where observations are collected in different environments modeled by different data distributions. The field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization aims to design methods that generalize better to test environments whose distributions differ from those observed during training. One line of such works has proposed to minimize the maximum risk across environments, a principle that we refer to as MaxRM (Maximum Risk Minimization). In this work, we introduce variants of random forests based on the principle of MaxRM. We provide computationally efficient algorithms and prove statistical consistency for our primary method. Our proposed method can be used with each of the following three risks: the mean squared error, the negative reward (which relates to the explained variance), and the regret (which quantifies the excess risk relative to the best predictor). For MaxRM with regret as the risk, we prove a novel out-of-sample guarantee over unseen test distributions. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods on both simulated and real-world data.",2025-12-11 09:10:52+00:00,"['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ME']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10445v1
Clustered Federated Learning with Hierarchical Knowledge Distillation,"Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing data heterogeneity and ensuring privacy in large distributed IoT environments. By clustering clients and training cluster-specific models, CFL enables personalized models tailored to groups of heterogeneous clients. However, conventional CFL approaches suffer from fragmented learning for training independent global models for each cluster and fail to take advantage of collective cluster insights. This paper advocates a shift to hierarchical CFL, allowing bi-level aggregation to train cluster-specific models at the edge and a unified global model at the cloud. This shift improves training efficiency yet might introduce communication challenges. To this end, we propose CFLHKD, a novel personalization scheme for integrating hierarchical cluster knowledge into CFL. Built upon multi-teacher knowledge distillation, CFLHKD enables inter-cluster knowledge sharing while preserving cluster-specific personalization. CFLHKD adopts a bi-level aggregation to bridge the gap between local and global learning. Extensive evaluations of standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFLHKD outperforms representative baselines in cluster-specific and global model accuracy and achieves a performance improvement of 3.32-7.57\%.",2025-12-11 09:08:35+00:00,"['cs.DC', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10443v1
An M-Health Algorithmic Approach to Identify and Assess Physiotherapy Exercises in Real Time,"This work presents an efficient algorithmic framework for real-time identification, classification, and evaluation of human physiotherapy exercises using mobile devices. The proposed method interprets a kinetic movement as a sequence of static poses, which are estimated from camera input using a pose-estimation neural network. Extracted body keypoints are transformed into trigonometric angle-based features and classified with lightweight supervised models to generate frame-level pose predictions and accuracy scores. To recognize full exercise movements and detect deviations from prescribed patterns, we employ a dynamic-programming scheme based on a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm, enabling robust sequence matching and localization of inaccuracies. The system operates entirely on the client side, ensuring scalability and real-time performance. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology and highlights its applicability to remote physiotherapy supervision and m-health applications.",2025-12-11 08:56:03+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10437v1
Targeted Data Protection for Diffusion Model by Matching Training Trajectory,"Recent advancements in diffusion models have made fine-tuning text-to-image models for personalization increasingly accessible, but have also raised significant concerns regarding unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement. Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs.",2025-12-11 08:47:41+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10433v1
Representation of the structure of graphs by sequences of instructions,"The representation of graphs is commonly based on the adjacency matrix concept. This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph. Therefore, it is envisaged that it could be useful to boost the processing of graphs by deep learning models. A tentative computational experiment is reported, with favorable results.",2025-12-11 08:40:06+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10429v1
Design and Implementation of a High-Precision Wind-Estimation UAV with Onboard Sensors,"Accurate real-time wind vector estimation is essential for enhancing the safety, navigation accuracy, and energy efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Traditional approaches rely on external sensors or simplify vehicle dynamics, which limits their applicability during agile flight or in resource-constrained platforms. This paper proposes a real-time wind estimation method based solely on onboard sensors. The approach first estimates external aerodynamic forces using a disturbance observer (DOB), and then maps these forces to wind vectors using a thin-plate spline (TPS) model. A custom-designed wind barrel mounted on the UAV enhances aerodynamic sensitivity, further improving estimation accuracy. The system is validated through comprehensive experiments in wind tunnels, indoor and outdoor flights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high-accuracy wind estimation across controlled and real-world conditions, with speed RMSEs as low as \SI{0.06}{m/s} in wind tunnel tests, \SI{0.22}{m/s} during outdoor hover, and below \SI{0.38}{m/s} in indoor and outdoor dynamic flights, and direction RMSEs under \ang{7.3} across all scenarios, outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the method provides vertical wind estimates -- unavailable in baselines -- with RMSEs below \SI{0.17}{m/s} even during fast indoor translations.",2025-12-11 08:39:55+00:00,"['cs.ET', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10428v1
Cooperative Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Question Answering: Mutual Information Exchange and Ranking by Contrasting Layers,"Since large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to generate factually inaccurate output, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained significant attention as a key means to mitigate this downside of harnessing only LLMs. However, existing RAG methods for simple and multi-hop question answering (QA) are still prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances.

Beyond Endpoints: Path-Centric Reasoning for Vectorized Off-Road Network Extraction,"Deep learning has advanced vectorized road extraction in urban settings, yet off-road environments remain underexplored and challenging. A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.",2025-12-11 08:29:27+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10416v1
How to Trick Your AI TA: A Systematic Study of Academic Jailbreaking in LLM Code Evaluation,"The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic judges for code evaluation is becoming increasingly prevalent in academic environments. But their reliability can be compromised by students who may employ adversarial prompting strategies in order to induce misgrading and secure undeserved academic advantages. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of jailbreaking LLM-based automated code evaluators in academic context. Our contributions are: (i) We systematically adapt 20+ jailbreaking strategies for jailbreaking AI code evaluators in the academic context, defining a new class of attacks termed academic jailbreaking. (ii) We release a poisoned dataset of 25K adversarial student submissions, specifically designed for the academic code-evaluation setting, sourced from diverse real-world coursework and paired with rubrics and human-graded references, and (iii) In order to capture the multidimensional impact of academic jailbreaking, we systematically adapt and define three jailbreaking metrics (Jailbreak Success Rate, Score Inflation, and Harmfulness). (iv) We comprehensively evalulate the academic jailbreaking attacks using six LLMs. We find that these models exhibit significant vulnerability, particularly to persuasive and role-play-based attacks (up to 97% JSR). Our adversarial dataset and benchmark suite lay the groundwork for next-generation robust LLM-based evaluators in academic code assessment.",2025-12-11 08:28:33+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10415v1
Boosting RL-Based Visual Reasoning with Selective Adversarial Entropy Intervention,"Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a common choice in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Considering existing RL-based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing studies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ignore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the diversity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective-adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which enhances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the entropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formulates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial objective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger answer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the effectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities. Code will be released once the paper is accepted.",2025-12-11 08:27:02+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10414v1
Sliding Window Attention Adaptation,"The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving ""sink"" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

The Eminence in Shadow: Exploiting Feature Boundary Ambiguity for Robust Backdoor Attacks,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) underpin critical applications yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, typically reliant on heuristic brute-force methods. Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios.",2025-12-11 08:09:07+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10402v1
Confucius Code Agent: An Open-sourced AI Software Engineer at Industrial Scale,"Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.",2025-12-11 08:05:58+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.SE']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10398v1

To overcome these limitations, we propose RoboNeuron, a universal deployment framework for embodied intelligence. RoboNeuron is the first framework to deeply integrate the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with the real-time execution backbone of the Robot Operating System (ROS). We utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a semantic bridge, enabling the LLM to dynamically orchestrate underlying robotic tools. The framework establishes a highly modular architecture that strictly decouples sensing, reasoning, and control by leveraging ROS's unified communication interfaces. Crucially, we introduce an automated tool to translate ROS messages into callable MCP functions, significantly streamlining development. RoboNeuron significantly enhances cross-scenario adaptability and component flexibility, while establishing a systematic platform for horizontal performance benchmarking, laying a robust foundation for scalable real-world embodied applications.",2025-12-11 07:58:19+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10394v1
Cross-modal Retrieval Models for Stripped Binary Analysis,"LLM-agent based binary code analysis has demonstrated significant potential across a wide range of software security scenarios, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, etc. In agent workflow, however, retrieving the positive from thousands of stripped binary functions based on user query remains under-studied and challenging, as the absence of symbolic information distinguishes it from source code retrieval. In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, the first two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped binary code analysis. It consists of two models: BinSeekEmbedding is trained on large-scale dataset to learn the semantic relevance of the binary code and the natural language description, furthermore, BinSeek-Reranker learns to carefully judge the relevance of the candidate code to the description with context augmentation. To this end, we built an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline to automate training construction, also deriving a domain benchmark for future research. Our evaluation results show that BinSeek achieved the state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the the same scale models by 31.42% in Rec@3 and 27.17% in MRR@3, as well as leading the advanced general-purpose models that have 16 times larger parameters.",2025-12-11 07:58:10+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10393v1
The Best of the Two Worlds: Harmonizing Semantic and Hash IDs for Sequential Recommendation,"Conventional Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) typically assign unique Hash IDs (HID) to construct item embeddings. These HID embeddings effectively learn collaborative information from historical user-item interactions, making them vulnerable to situations where most items are rarely consumed (the long-tail problem). Recent methods that incorporate auxiliary information often suffer from noisy collaborative sharing caused by co-occurrence signals or semantic homogeneity caused by flat dense embeddings. Semantic IDs (SIDs), with their capability of code sharing and multi-granular semantic modeling, provide a promising alternative. However, the collaborative overwhelming phenomenon hinders the further development of SID-based methods. The quantization mechanisms commonly compromise the uniqueness of identifiers required for modeling head items, creating a performance seesaw between head and tail items. To address this dilemma, we propose \textbf{\name}, a novel framework that harmonizes the SID and HID. Specifically, we devise a dual-branch modeling architecture that enables the model to capture both the multi-granular semantics within SID while preserving the unique collaborative identity of HID. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level alignment strategy that bridges the two representations, facilitating knowledge transfer and supporting robust preference modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that \name~ effectively balances recommendation quality for both head and tail items while surpassing the existing baselines.

Towards Fine-Grained Recognition with Large Visual Language Models: Benchmark and Optimization Strategies,"Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable progress, enabling sophisticated vision-language interaction and dialogue applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on reasoning tasks, often neglecting fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Recognition Open World (FROW) benchmark, designed for detailed evaluation of LVLMs with GPT-4o. On the basis of that, we propose a novel optimization strategy from two perspectives: \textit{data construction} and \textit{training process}, to improve the performance of LVLMs. Our dataset includes mosaic data, which combines multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data, generated from real-world questions and answers using GPT-4o, creating a comprehensive framework for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs. Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1\% and open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10\%-20\% and content accuracy by 6\%-12\%. Meanwhile, incorporating fine-grained data into the pre-training phase can improve the model's category recognition accuracy by up to 10\%.

Neural personal sound zones with flexible bright zone control,"Personal sound zone (PSZ) reproduction system, which attempts to create distinct virtual acoustic scenes for different listeners at their respective positions within the same spatial area using one loudspeaker array, is a fundamental technology in the application of virtual reality. For practical applications, the reconstruction targets must be measured on the same fixed receiver array used to record the local room impulse responses (RIRs) from the loudspeaker array to the control points in each PSZ, which makes the system inconvenient and costly for real-world use. In this paper, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for PSZ reproduction with flexible control microphone grid and alternative reproduction target is presented, utilizing the virtual target scene as inputs and the PSZ pre-filters as output. Experimental results of the proposed method are compared with the traditional method, demonstrating that the proposed method is able to handle varied reproduction targets on flexible control point grid using only one training session.

"D2M: A Decentralized, Privacy-Preserving, Incentive-Compatible Data Marketplace for Collaborative Learning","The rising demand for collaborative machine learning and data analytics calls for secure and decentralized data sharing frameworks that balance privacy, trust, and incentives. Existing approaches, including federated learning (FL) and blockchain-based data markets, fall short: FL often depends on trusted aggregators and lacks Byzantine robustness, while blockchain frameworks struggle with computation-intensive training and incentive integration.
  We present \prot, a decentralized data marketplace that unifies federated learning, blockchain arbitration, and economic incentives into a single framework for privacy-preserving data sharing. \prot\ enables data buyers to submit bid-based requests via blockchain smart contracts, which manage auctions, escrow, and dispute resolution. Computationally intensive training is delegated to \cone\ (\uline{Co}mpute \uline{N}etwork for \uline{E}xecution), an off-chain distributed execution layer. To safeguard against adversarial behavior, \prot\ integrates a modified YODA protocol with exponentially growing execution sets for resilient consensus, and introduces Corrected OSMD to mitigate malicious or low-quality contributions from sellers. All protocols are incentive-compatible, and our game-theoretic analysis establishes honesty as the dominant strategy.
  We implement \prot\ on Ethereum and evaluate it over benchmark datasets -- MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 -- under varying adversarial settings. \prot\ achieves up to 99\% accuracy on MNIST and 90\% on Fashion-MNIST, with less than 3\% degradation up to 30\% Byzantine nodes, and 56\% accuracy on CIFAR-10 despite its complexity. Our results show that \prot\ ensures privacy, maintains robustness under adversarial conditions, and scales efficiently with the number of participants, making it a practical foundation for real-world decentralized data sharing.",2025-12-11 07:38:05+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI', 'cs.DC', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10372v1
AgentProg: Empowering Long-Horizon GUI Agents with Program-Guided Context Management,"The rapid development of mobile GUI agents has stimulated growing research interest in long-horizon task automation. However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

LLM-Empowered Representation Learning for Emerging Item Recommendation,"In this work, we tackle the challenge of recommending emerging items, whose interactions gradually accumulate over time. Existing methods often overlook this dynamic process, typically assuming that emerging items have few or even no historical interactions. Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.",2025-12-11 07:36:44+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10370v1

Visual Funnel: Resolving Contextual Blindness in Multimodal Large Language Models,"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, but often fail to perceive fine-grained visual details, limiting their applicability in precision-demanding tasks. While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: ""Contextual Blindness"". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.",2025-12-11 07:22:54+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10362v1
CLASH: Collaborative Large-Small Hierarchical Framework for Continuous Vision-and-Language Navigation,"Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires robots to follow natural language instructions and navigate complex environments without prior maps. While recent vision-language large models demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they often underperform task-specific panoramic small models in VLN tasks. To address this, we propose CLASH (Collaborative Large-Small Hierarchy), a VLN-CE framework that integrates a reactive small-model planner (RSMP) with a reflective large-model reasoner (RLMR). RSMP adopts a causal-learning-based dual-branch architecture to enhance generalization, while RLMR leverages panoramic visual prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning to support interpretable spatial understanding and navigation. We further introduce an uncertainty-aware collaboration mechanism (UCM) that adaptively fuses decisions from both models. For obstacle avoidance, in simulation, we replace the rule-based controller with a fully learnable point-goal policy, and in real-world deployment, we design a LiDAR-based clustering module for generating navigable waypoints and pair it with an online SLAM-based local controller. CLASH achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results (ranking 1-st) on the VLN-CE leaderboard, significantly improving SR and SPL on the test-unseen set over the previous SoTA methods. Real-world experiments demonstrate CLASH's strong robustness, validating its effectiveness in both simulation and deployment scenarios.",2025-12-11 07:20:06+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10360v1
Dynamics of Agentic Loops in Large Language Models: A Geometric Theory of Trajectories,"Agentic systems built on large language models operate through recursive feedback loops, where each output becomes the next input. Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems. We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors. Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion. Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.",2025-12-11 07:06:14+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10350v1
Design and Validation of an Under-actuated Robotic Finger with Synchronous Tendon Routing,"Tendon-driven under-actuated robotic fingers provide advantages for dexterous manipulation through reduced actuator requirements and simplified mechanical design. However, achieving both high load capacity and adaptive compliance in a compact form remains challenging. This paper presents an under-actuated tendon-driven robotic finger (UTRF) featuring a synchronous tendon routing that mechanically couples all joints with fixed angular velocity ratios, enabling the entire finger to be actuated by a single actuator. This approach significantly reduces the number of actuators required in multi-finger hands, resulting in a lighter and more compact structure without sacrificing stiffness or compliance. The kinematic and static models of the finger are derived, incorporating tendon elasticity to predict structural stiffness. A single-finger prototype was fabricated and tested under static loading, showing an average deflection prediction error of 1.0 mm (0.322% of total finger length) and a measured stiffness of 1.2x10^3 N/m under a 3 kg tip load.

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.",2025-12-11 07:05:36+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10348v1
A Privacy-Preserving Cloud Architecture for Distributed Machine Learning at Scale,"Distributed machine learning systems require strong privacy guarantees, verifiable compliance, and scalable deployment across heterogeneous and multi-cloud environments. This work introduces a cloud-native privacy-preserving architecture that integrates federated learning, differential privacy, zero-knowledge compliance proofs, and adaptive governance powered by reinforcement learning. The framework supports secure model training and inference without centralizing sensitive data, while enabling cryptographically verifiable policy enforcement across institutions and cloud platforms. A full prototype deployed across hybrid Kubernetes clusters demonstrates reduced membership-inference risk, consistent enforcement of formal privacy budgets, and stable model performance under differential privacy. Experimental evaluation across multi-institution workloads shows that the architecture maintains utility with minimal overhead while providing continuous, risk-aware governance. The proposed framework establishes a practical foundation for deploying trustworthy and compliant distributed machine learning systems at scale.",2025-12-11 06:46:46+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10341v1
On the Collapse of Generative Paths: A Criterion and Correction for Diffusion Steering,"Inference-time steering enables pretrained diffusion/flow models to be adapted to new tasks without retraining. A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation.",2025-12-11 06:44:08+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10339v1
Multilingual VLM Training: Adapting an English-Trained VLM to French,"Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.",2025-12-11 06:38:51+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10336v1
User-Feedback-Driven Continual Adaptation for Vision-and-Language Navigation,"Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to navigate complex environments by following natural-language instructions. General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.",2025-12-11 06:11:45+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10322v1
Design of a six wheel suspension and a three-axis linear actuation mechanism for a laser weeding robot,"Mobile robots are increasingly utilized in agriculture to automate labor-intensive tasks such as weeding, sowing, harvesting and soil analysis. Recently, agricultural robots have been developed to detect and remove weeds using mechanical tools or precise herbicide sprays. Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism. Field tests have demonstrated the robot's capability to navigate agricultural terrains effectively by overcoming obstacles up to 15 cm in height. At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal. This combination of speed, accuracy, and efficiency highlights the robot's potential for significantly enhancing precision farming practices.",2025-12-11 06:11:05+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.CV', 'eess.SY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10319v1
Translating Informal Proofs into Formal Proofs Using a Chain of States,"We address the problem of translating informal mathematical proofs expressed in natural language into formal proofs in Lean4 under a constrained computational budget. Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states. Empirical results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher proof success rates.",2025-12-11 06:08:34+00:00,"['cs.LO', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10317v1
EpiPlanAgent: Agentic Automated Epidemic Response Planning,"Epidemic response planning is essential yet traditionally reliant on labor-intensive manual methods.

The multi-agent framework integrated task decomposition, knowledge grounding, and simulation modules. Public health professionals tested the system using real-world outbreak scenarios in a controlled evaluation. Results demonstrated that EpiPlanAgent significantly improved the completeness and guideline alignment of plans while drastically reducing development time compared to manual workflows. Expert evaluation confirmed high consistency between AI-generated and human-authored content. User feedback indicated strong perceived utility.

InfoCom: Kilobyte-Scale Communication-Efficient Collaborative Perception with Information Bottleneck,"Precise environmental perception is critical for the reliability of autonomous driving systems. While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.",2025-12-11 05:51:02+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10305v1
Trustworthy Orchestration Artificial Intelligence by the Ten Criteria with Control-Plane Governance,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.",2025-12-11 05:49:26+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.ET']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10304v1
Investigating The Functional Roles of Attention Heads in Vision Language Models: Evidence for Reasoning Modules,"Despite excelling on multimodal benchmarks, vision-language models (VLMs) largely remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.",2025-12-11 05:42:53+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10300v1
FLARE: A Wireless Side-Channel Fingerprinting Attack on Federated Learning,"Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while safeguarding data and user privacy. However, FL remains susceptible to privacy threats that can compromise data via direct means. That said, indirectly compromising the confidentiality of the FL model architecture (e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN)) on a client device by an outsider remains unexplored. If leaked, this information can enable next-level attacks tailored to the architecture. This paper proposes a novel side-channel fingerprinting attack, leveraging flow-level and packet-level statistics of encrypted wireless traffic from an FL client to infer its deep learning model architecture. We name it FLARE, a fingerprinting framework based on FL Architecture REconnaissance. Evaluation across various CNN and RNN variants-including pre-trained and custom models trained over IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi-shows that FLARE achieves over 98% F1-score in closed-world and up to 91% in open-world scenarios. These results reveal that CNN and RNN models leak distinguishable traffic patterns, enabling architecture fingerprinting even under realistic FL settings with hardware, software, and data heterogeneity. To our knowledge, this is the first work to fingerprint FL model architectures by sniffing encrypted wireless traffic, exposing a critical side-channel vulnerability in current FL systems.",2025-12-11 05:32:34+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10296v1
Lies We Can Trust: Quantifying Action Uncertainty with Inaccurate Stochastic Dynamics through Conformalized Nonholonomic Lie Groups,"We propose Conformal Lie-group Action Prediction Sets (CLAPS), a symmetry-aware conformal prediction-based algorithm that constructs, for a given action, a set guaranteed to contain the resulting system configuration at a user-defined probability. Our assurance holds under both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, non-asymptotically, and does not require strong assumptions about the true system dynamics, the uncertainty sources, or the quality of the approximate dynamics model. Typically, uncertainty quantification is tackled by making strong assumptions about the error distribution or magnitude, or by relying on uncalibrated uncertainty estimates - i.e., with no link to frequentist probabilities - which are insufficient for safe control. Recently, conformal prediction has emerged as a statistical framework capable of providing distribution-free probabilistic guarantees on test-time prediction accuracy. While current conformal methods treat robots as Euclidean points, many systems have non-Euclidean configurations, e.g., some mobile robots have SE(2). In this work, we rigorously analyze configuration errors using Lie groups, extending previous Euclidean Space theoretical guarantees to SE(2). Our experiments on a simulated JetBot, and on a real MBot, suggest that by considering the configuration space's structure, our symmetry-informed nonconformity score leads to more volume-efficient prediction regions which represent the underlying uncertainty better than existing approaches.",2025-12-11 05:26:56+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'eess.SY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10294v1
MotionEdit: Benchmarking and Learning Motion-Centric Image Editing,"We introduce MotionEdit, a novel dataset for motion-centric image editing-the task of modifying subject actions and interactions while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility. Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.
  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness.",2025-12-11 04:53:58+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10284v1
Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC) for Representation Learning,"Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \textit{content-target} and \textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines.",2025-12-11 04:49:44+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10282v1
Graph Neural Network Based Adaptive Threat Detection for Cloud Identity and Access Management Logs,"The rapid expansion of cloud infrastructures and distributed identity systems has significantly increased the complexity and attack surface of modern enterprises. Traditional rule based or signature driven detection systems are often inadequate in identifying novel or evolving threats within Identity and Access Management logs, where anomalous behavior may appear statistically benign but contextually malicious. This paper presents a Graph Neural Network Based Adaptive Threat Detection framework designed to learn latent user resource interaction patterns from IAM audit trails in real time. By modeling IAM logs as heterogeneous dynamic graphs, the proposed system captures temporal, relational, and contextual dependencies across entities such as users, roles, sessions, and access actions. The model incorporates attention based aggregation and graph embedding updates to enable continual adaptation to changing cloud environments. Experimental evaluation on synthesized and real world IAM datasets demonstrates that the proposed method achieves higher detection precision and recall than baseline LSTM and GCN classifiers, while maintaining scalability across multi tenant cloud environments. The frameworks adaptability enables proactive mitigation of insider threats, privilege escalation, and lateral movement attacks, contributing to the foundation of AI driven zero trust access analytics.

The algorithm is sound and computes all ESSs in nondegenerate games and a subset of them in degenerate games which contain an infinite continuum of symmetric Nash equilibria.

Reverse Thinking Enhances Missing Information Detection in Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks, yet they often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting issues such as incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations. While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information. In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness.",2025-12-11 04:25:17+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10273v1
Hybrid Learning and Optimization-Based Dynamic Scheduling for DL Workloads on Heterogeneous GPU Clusters,"Modern cloud platforms increasingly host large-scale deep learning (DL) workloads, demanding high-throughput, low-latency GPU scheduling. However, the growing heterogeneity of GPU clusters and limited visibility into application characteristics pose major challenges for existing schedulers, which often rely on offline profiling or application-specific assumptions. We present RLTune, an application-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling framework that dynamically prioritizes and allocates DL jobs on heterogeneous GPU clusters. RLTune integrates RL-driven prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize system-wide objectives such as job completion time (JCT), queueing delay, and resource utilization. Trained on large-scale production traces from Microsoft Philly, Helios, and Alibaba, RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens JCT by as much as 70 percent. Unlike prior approaches, RLTune generalizes across diverse workloads without requiring per-job profiling, making it practical for cloud providers to deploy at scale for more efficient, fair, and sustainable DL workload management.",2025-12-11 04:19:44+00:00,"['cs.DC', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10271v1
RobustSora: De-Watermarked Benchmark for Robust AI-Generated Video Detection,"The proliferation of AI-generated video technologies poses challenges to information integrity. While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research.",2025-12-11 03:12:56+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10248v1
Task-Oriented Grasping Using Reinforcement Learning with a Contextual Reward Machine,"This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Contextual Reward Machine for task-oriented grasping. The Contextual Reward Machine reduces task complexity by decomposing grasping tasks into manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task is associated with a stage-specific context, including a reward function, an action space, and a state abstraction function. This contextual information enables efficient intra-stage guidance and improves learning efficiency by reducing the state-action space and guiding exploration within clearly defined boundaries. In addition, transition rewards are introduced to encourage or penalize transitions between stages which guides the model toward desirable stage sequences and further accelerates convergence. When integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, the proposed method achieved a 95% success rate across 1,000 simulated grasping tasks encompassing diverse objects, affordances, and grasp topologies. It outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in both learning speed and success rate. The approach was transferred to a real robot, where it achieved a success rate of 83.3% in 60 grasping tasks over six affordances. These experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy, data efficiency, and learning efficiency. They underscore the model's potential to advance task-oriented grasping in both simulated and real-world settings.",2025-12-11 02:42:40+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10235v1
InFerActive: Towards Scalable Human Evaluation of Large Language Models through Interactive Inference,"Human evaluation remains the gold standard for evaluating outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). The current evaluation paradigm reviews numerous individual responses, leading to significant scalability challenges. LLM outputs can be more efficiently represented as a tree structure, reflecting their autoregressive generation process and stochastic token selection. However, conventional tree visualization cannot scale to the exponentially large trees generated by modern sampling methods of LLMs. To address this problem, we present InFerActive, an interactive inference system for scalable human evaluation. InFerActive enables on-demand exploration through probability-based filtering and evaluation features, while bridging the semantic gap between computational tokens and human-readable text through adaptive visualization techniques. Through a technical evaluation and user study (N=12), we demonstrate that InFerActive significantly improves evaluation efficiency and enables more comprehensive assessment of model behavior. We further conduct expert case studies that demonstrate InFerActive's practical applicability and potential for transforming LLM evaluation workflows.",2025-12-11 02:41:14+00:00,"['cs.HC', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10234v1
Adaptive Information Routing for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting,"Time series forecasting is a critical task for artificial intelligence with numerous real-world applications. Traditional approaches primarily rely on historical time series data to predict the future values. However, in practical scenarios, this is often insufficient for accurate predictions due to the limited information available. To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks.",2025-12-11 02:25:27+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10229v1
Latent Chain-of-Thought World Modeling for End-to-End Driving,"Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.",2025-12-11 02:22:07+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10226v1
Federated Domain Generalization with Latent Space Inversion,"Federated domain generalization (FedDG) addresses distribution shifts among clients in a federated learning framework. FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation.

Active Optics for Hyperspectral Imaging of Reflective Agricultural Leaf Sensors,"Monitoring plant health increasingly relies on leaf-mounted sensors that provide real-time physiological data, yet efficiently locating and sampling these sensors in complex agricultural environments remains a major challenge. We present an integrated, adaptive, and scalable system that autonomously detects and interrogates plant sensors using a coordinated suite of low-cost optical components including a LiDAR, liquid lens, monochrome camera, filter wheel, and Fast Steering Mirror (FSM). The system first uses LiDAR to identify the distinct reflective signatures of sensors within the field, then dynamically redirects the camera s field of view via the FSM to target each sensor for hyperspectral imaging. The liquid lens continuously adjusts focus to maintain image sharpness across varying depths, enabling precise spectral measurements. We validated the system in controlled indoor experiments, demonstrating accurate detection and tracking of reflective plant sensors and successful acquisition of their spectral data. To our knowledge, no other system currently integrates these sensing and optical modalities for agricultural monitoring. This work establishes a foundation for adaptive, low-cost, and automated plant sensor interrogation, representing a significant step toward scalable, real-time plant health monitoring in precision agriculture.",2025-12-11 02:03:07+00:00,"['eess.IV', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10213v1
ID-PaS : Identity-Aware Predict-and-Search for General Mixed-Integer Linear Programs,"Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MIPs) are powerful and flexible tools for modeling a wide range of real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.",2025-12-11 01:58:28+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10211v1
An exploration for higher efficiency in multi objective optimisation with reinforcement learning,"Efficiency in optimisation and search processes persists to be one of the challenges, which affects the performance and use of optimisation algorithms. Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions. This paper overviews a generalisation approach proposed with certain stages completed and phases outstanding that is aimed to help demonstrate the efficiency of using multi-objective reinforcement learning.",2025-12-11 01:58:04+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.NE']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10208v1
CP-Env: Evaluating Large Language Models on Clinical Pathways in a Controllable Hospital Environment,"Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages. Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios. We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways. CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution. We propose a three-tiered evaluation framework encompassing Clinical Efficacy, Process Competency, and Professional Ethics. Results reveal that most models struggle with pathway complexity, exhibiting hallucinations and losing critical diagnostic details. Interestingly, excessive reasoning steps can sometimes prove counterproductive, while top models tend to exhibit reduced tool dependency through internalized knowledge. CP-Env advances medical AI agents development through comprehensive end-to-end clinical evaluation.

Offscript: Automated Auditing of Instruction Adherence in LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative search systems are increasingly used for information seeking by diverse populations with varying preferences for knowledge sourcing and presentation. While users can customize LLM behavior through custom instructions and behavioral prompts, no mechanism exists to evaluate whether these instructions are being followed effectively. We present Offscript, an automated auditing tool that efficiently identifies potential instruction following failures in LLMs. In a pilot study analyzing custom instructions sourced from Reddit, Offscript detected potential deviations from instructed behavior in 86.4% of conversations, 22.2% of which were confirmed as material violations through human review. Our findings suggest that automated auditing serves as a viable approach for evaluating compliance to behavioral instructions related to information seeking.",2025-12-11 00:11:50+00:00,"['cs.HC', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10172v1
The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index,"Foundation model developers are among the world's most important companies. As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.",2025-12-11 00:01:53+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CY', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10169v1
Enhancing Large Language Models for End-to-End Circuit Analysis Problem Solving,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in data-rich domains such as programming, but their reliability in engineering tasks remains limited. Circuit analysis -- requiring multimodal understanding and precise mathematical reasoning -- highlights these challenges. Although Gemini 2.5 Pro improves diagram interpretation and analog-circuit reasoning, it still struggles to consistently produce correct solutions when given both text and circuit diagrams. At the same time, engineering education needs scalable AI tools capable of generating accurate solutions for tasks such as automated homework feedback and question-answering. This paper presents an enhanced, end-to-end circuit problem solver built on Gemini 2.5 Pro. We first benchmark Gemini on a representative set of undergraduate circuit problems and identify two major failure modes: 1) circuit-recognition hallucinations, particularly incorrect source polarity detection, and 2) reasoning-process hallucinations, such as incorrect current directions. To address recognition errors, we integrate a fine-tuned YOLO detector and OpenCV processing to isolate voltage and current sources, enabling Gemini to re-identify source polarities from cropped images with near-perfect accuracy. To reduce reasoning errors, we introduce an ngspice-based verification loop in which Gemini generates a .cir file, ngspice simulates the circuit, and discrepancies trigger iterative regeneration with optional human-in-the-loop review. Across 83 problems, the proposed pipeline achieves a 97.59% success rate (81 correct solutions), substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro's original 79.52% accuracy. This system extends LLM capabilities for multimodal engineering problem-solving and supports the creation of high-quality educational datasets and AI-powered instructional tools.",2025-12-10 23:38:14+00:00,"['cs.CY', 'cs.AI', 'cs.HC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10159v1
Unforgotten Safety: Preserving Safety Alignment of Large Language Models with Continual Learning,"The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important with their democratization. In this paper, we study the safety degradation that comes with adapting LLMs to new tasks. We attribute this safety compromise to catastrophic forgetting and frame the problem of preserving safety when fine-tuning as a continual learning (CL) problem. We consider the fine-tuning-as-a-service setup where the user uploads their data to a service provider to get a customized model that excels on the user's selected task. We adapt several CL approaches from the literature and systematically evaluate their ability to mitigate safety degradation. These include regularization-based, memory-based, and model merging approaches. We consider two scenarios, (1) benign user data and (2) poisoned user data. Our results demonstrate that CL approaches consistently achieve lower attack success rates than standard fine-tuning. Among these, DER outperforms both other CL methods and existing safety-preserving baselines while maintaining task utility. These findings generalize across three downstream tasks (GSM8K, SST2, Code) and three model families (LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2B), establishing CL as a practical solution to preserve safety.",2025-12-10 23:16:47+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10150v1
PARAN: Persona-Augmented Review ANswering system on Food Delivery Review Dataset,"Personalized review response generation presents a significant challenge in domains where user information is limited, such as food delivery platforms. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful text generation capabilities, they often produce generic responses when lacking contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset collected from a Korean food delivery app, and assess its impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of persona-augmented prompting in enhancing the relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.",2025-12-10 23:04:48+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10148v1
Universal Hirschberg for Width Bounded Dynamic Programs,"Hirschberg's algorithm (1975) reduces the space complexity for the longest common subsequence problem from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ via recursive midpoint bisection on a grid dynamic program (DP). We show that the underlying idea generalizes to a broad class of dynamic programs with local dependencies on directed acyclic graphs (DP DAGs). Modeling a DP as deterministic time evolution over a topologically ordered DAG with frontier width $ω$ and bounded in-degree, and assuming a max-type semiring with deterministic tie breaking, we prove that in a standard offline random-access model any such DP admits deterministic traceback in space $O(ω\log T + (\log T)^{O(1)})$ cells over a fixed finite alphabet, where $T$ is the number of states. Our construction replaces backward dynamic programs by forward-only recomputation and organizes the time order into a height-compressed recursion tree whose nodes expose small ""middle frontiers'' across which every optimal path must pass. The framework yields near-optimal traceback bounds for asymmetric and banded sequence alignment, one-dimensional recurrences, and dynamic-programming formulations on graphs of bounded pathwidth. We also show that an $Ω(ω)$ space term (in bits) is unavoidable in forward single-pass models and discuss conjectured $\sqrt{T}$-type barriers in streaming settings, supporting the view that space-efficient traceback is a structural property of width-bounded DP DAGs rather than a peculiarity of grid-based algorithms.",2025-12-10 22:26:22+00:00,"['cs.DS', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10132v1
Inertial Magnetic SLAM Systems Using Low-Cost Sensors,"Spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields offer a valuable, non-visual information source for positioning. Among systems leveraging this, magnetic field-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are particularly attractive because they can provide positioning information and build a magnetic field map on the fly. Moreover, they have bounded error within mapped regions. However, state-of-the-art methods typically require low-drift odometry data provided by visual odometry or a wheel encoder, etc. This is because these systems need to minimize/reduce positioning errors while exploring, which happens when they are in unmapped regions. To address these limitations, this work proposes a loosely coupled and a tightly coupled inertial magnetic SLAM (IM-SLAM) system. The proposed systems use commonly available low-cost sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer array, and a barometer. The use of non-visual data provides a significant advantage over visual-based systems, making it robust to low-visibility conditions. Both systems employ state-space representations, and magnetic field models on different scales. The difference lies in how they use a local and global magnetic field model. The loosely coupled system uses these models separately in two state-space models, while the tightly coupled system integrates them into one state-space model. Experiment results show that the tightly coupled IM-SLAM system achieves lower positioning errors than the loosely coupled system in most scenarios, with typical errors on the order of meters per 100 meters traveled. These results demonstrate the feasiblity of developing a full 3D IM-SLAM systems using low-cost sensors and the potential of applying these systems in emergency response scenarios such as mine/fire rescue.",2025-12-10 22:22:00+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'eess.SP']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10128v1
"Workflow is All You Need: Escaping the ""Statistical Smoothing Trap"" via High-Entropy Information Foraging and Adversarial Pacing","Central to long-form text generation in vertical domains is the ""impossible trinity"" confronting current large language models (LLMs): the simultaneous achievement of low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression. This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5).",2025-12-10 22:13:55+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CY', 'q-fin.GN']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10121v1
VocSim: A Training-free Benchmark for Zero-shot Content Identity in Single-source Audio,"General-purpose audio representations aim to map acoustically variable instances of the same event to nearby points, resolving content identity in a zero-shot setting. Unlike supervised classification benchmarks that measure adaptability via parameter updates, we introduce VocSim, a training-free benchmark probing the intrinsic geometric alignment of frozen embeddings. VocSim aggregates 125k single-source clips from 19 corpora spanning human speech, animal vocalizations, and environmental sounds. By restricting to single-source audio, we isolate content representation from the confound of source separation. We evaluate embeddings using Precision@k for local purity and the Global Separation Rate (GSR) for point-wise class separation. To calibrate GSR, we report lift over an empirical permutation baseline. Across diverse foundation models, a simple pipeline, frozen Whisper encoder features, time-frequency pooling, and label-free PCA, yields strong zero-shot performance. However, VocSim also uncovers a consistent generalization gap. On blind, low-resource speech, local retrieval drops sharply. While performance remains statistically distinguishable from chance, the absolute geometric structure collapses, indicating a failure to generalize to unseen phonotactics. As external validation, our top embeddings predict avian perceptual similarity, improve bioacoustic classification, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the HEAR benchmark. We posit that the intrinsic geometric quality measured here proxies utility in unlisted downstream applications. We release data, code, and a public leaderboard to standardize the evaluation of intrinsic audio geometry.",2025-12-10 22:13:12+00:00,"['cs.SD', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10120v1
CHyLL: Learning Continuous Neural Representations of Hybrid Systems,"Learning the flows of hybrid systems that have both continuous and discrete time dynamics is challenging. The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems. Finally, we apply CHyLL to the stochastic optimal control problem.",2025-12-10 22:07:16+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.RO', 'eess.SP', 'eess.SY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10117v1
Fast Functionally Redundant Inverse Kinematics for Robotic Toolpath Optimisation in Manufacturing Tasks,"Industrial automation with six-axis robotic arms is critical for many manufacturing tasks, including welding and additive manufacturing applications; however, many of these operations are functionally redundant due to the symmetrical tool axis, which effectively makes the operation a five-axis task. Exploiting this redundancy is crucial for achieving the desired workspace and dexterity required for the feasibility and optimisation of toolpath planning. Inverse kinematics algorithms can solve this in a fast, reactive framework, but these techniques are underutilised over the more computationally expensive offline planning methods. We propose a novel algorithm to solve functionally redundant inverse kinematics for robotic manipulation utilising a task space decomposition approach, the damped least-squares method and Halley's method to achieve fast and robust solutions with reduced joint motion. We evaluate our methodology in the case of toolpath optimisation in a cold spray coating application on a non-planar surface. The functionally redundant inverse kinematics algorithm can quickly solve motion plans that minimise joint motion, expanding the feasible operating space of the complex toolpath. We validate our approach on an industrial ABB manipulator and cold-spray gun executing the computed toolpath.",2025-12-10 22:07:07+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10116v1
AgriRegion: Region-Aware Retrieval for High-Fidelity Agricultural Advice,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in democratizing access to information. However, in the domain of agriculture, general-purpose models frequently suffer from contextual hallucination, which provides non-factual advice or answers are scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations. We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.",2025-12-10 22:06:41+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10114v1
Modeling Narrative Archetypes in Conspiratorial Narratives: Insights from Singapore-Based Telegram Groups,"Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.
  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.",2025-12-10 21:51:16+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10105v1

"Push Smarter, Not Harder: Hierarchical RL-Diffusion Policy for Efficient Nonprehensile Manipulation","Nonprehensile manipulation, such as pushing objects across cluttered environments, presents a challenging control problem due to complex contact dynamics and long-horizon planning requirements. In this work, we propose HeRD, a hierarchical reinforcement learning-diffusion policy that decomposes pushing tasks into two levels: high-level goal selection and low-level trajectory generation. We employ a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) agent to select intermediate spatial goals, and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion model to generate feasible, efficient trajectories to reach them.
  This architecture combines the long-term reward maximizing behaviour of RL with the generative capabilities of diffusion models. We evaluate our method in a 2D simulation environment and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in success rate, path efficiency, and generalization across multiple environment configurations. Our results suggest that hierarchical control with generative low-level planning is a promising direction for scalable, goal-directed nonprehensile manipulation.

MedXAI: A Retrieval-Augmented and Self-Verifying Framework for Knowledge-Guided Medical Image Analysis,"Accurate and interpretable image-based diagnosis remains a fundamental challenge in medical AI, particularly under domain shifts and rare-class conditions. Deep learning models often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Medical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician-derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare-class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading. Ex periments on ten multicenter datasets show consistent gains, including a 3% improvement in cross-domain generalization and a 10% improvmnet in F1 score of rare class, substantially outperforming strong deep learning baselines. Ablations confirm that the symbolic components act as effective clinical priors and regularizers, improving robustness under distribution shift.

Interpretable Embeddings with Sparse Autoencoders: A Data Analysis Toolkit,"Analyzing large-scale text corpora is a core challenge in machine learning, crucial for tasks like identifying undesirable model behaviors or biases in training data. Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding ""trigger"" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.",2025-12-10 21:26:24+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10092v1
Defining the Scope of Learning Analytics: An Axiomatic Approach for Analytic Practice and Measurable Learning Phenomena,"Learning Analytics (LA) has rapidly expanded through practical and technological innovation, yet its foundational identity has remained theoretically under-specified. This paper addresses this gap by proposing the first axiomatic theory that formally defines the essential structure, scope, and limitations of LA. Derived from the psychological definition of learning and the methodological requirements of LA, the framework consists of five axioms specifying discrete observation, experience construction, state transition, and inference. From these axioms, we derive a set of theorems and propositions that clarify the epistemological stance of LA, including the inherent unobservability of learner states, the irreducibility of temporal order, constraints on reachable states, and the impossibility of deterministically predicting future learning. We further define LA structure and LA practice as formal objects, demonstrating the sufficiency and necessity of the axioms and showing that diverse LA approaches -- such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and dashboards -- can be uniformly explained within this framework. The theory provides guiding principles for designing analytic methods and interpreting learning data while avoiding naive behaviorism and category errors by establishing an explicit theoretical inference layer between observations and states. This work positions LA as a rigorous science of state transition systems based on observability, establishing the theoretical foundation necessary for the field's maturation as a scholarly discipline.",2025-12-10 21:07:19+00:00,"['cs.CY', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10081v1
What Kind of Reasoning (if any) is an LLM actually doing? On the Stochastic Nature and Abductive Appearance of Large Language Models,"This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.",2025-12-10 21:06:28+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10080v1

Classifying Metamorphic versus Single-Fold Proteins with Statistical Learning and AlphaFold2,"The remarkable success of AlphaFold2 in providing accurate atomic-level prediction of protein structures from their amino acid sequence has transformed approaches to the protein folding problem. However, its core paradigm of mapping one sequence to one structure may only be appropriate for single-fold proteins with one stable conformation. Metamorphic proteins, which can adopt multiple distinct conformations, have conformational diversity that cannot be adequately modeled by AlphaFold2. Hence, classifying whether a given protein is metamorphic or single-fold remains a critical challenge for both laboratory experiments and computational methods. To address this challenge, we developed a novel classification framework by re-purposing AlphaFold2 to generate conformational ensembles via a multiple sequence alignment sampling method. From these ensembles, we extract a comprehensive set of features characterizing the conformational ensemble's modality and structural dispersion. A random forest classifier trained on a carefully curated benchmark dataset of known metamorphic and single-fold proteins achieves a mean AUC of 0.869 with cross-validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our integrated approach. Furthermore, by applying our classifier to 600 randomly sampled proteins from the Protein Data Bank, we identified several potential metamorphic protein candidates -- including the 40S ribosomal protein S30, whose conformational change is crucial for its secondary function in antimicrobial defense. By combining AI-driven protein structure prediction with statistical learning, our work provides a powerful new approach for discovering metamorphic proteins and deepens our understanding of their role in their molecular function.",2025-12-10 20:37:21+00:00,"['stat.AP', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10066v1
Linear socio-demographic representations emerge in Large Language Models from indirect cues,"We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.",2025-12-10 20:36:36+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.HC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10065v1
Mind the Gap! Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research,"While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, ""aligned"" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.",2025-12-10 20:28:13+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CY', 'cs.HC', 'cs.SI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10058v1
Parallel Decoder Transformer: Model-Internal Parallel Decoding with Speculative Invariance via Note Conditioning,"Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.",2025-12-10 20:19:10+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CL']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10054v1
DB2-TransF: All You Need Is Learnable Daubechies Wavelets for Time Series Forecasting,"Time series forecasting requires models that can efficiently capture complex temporal dependencies, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional settings. While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

Detailed balance in large language model-driven agents,"Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.",2025-12-10 20:04:23+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'cs.AI', 'nlin.AO', 'physics.data-an']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10047v1
SimWorld-Robotics: Synthesizing Photorealistic and Dynamic Urban Environments for Multimodal Robot Navigation and Collaboration,"Recent advances in foundation models have shown promising results in developing generalist robotics that can perform diverse tasks in open-ended scenarios given multimodal inputs. However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.",2025-12-10 20:04:08+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10046v1
MetaVoxel: Joint Diffusion Modeling of Imaging and Clinical Metadata,"Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.",2025-12-10 19:47:52+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10041v1
Intelligently Weighting Multiple Reference Models for Direct Preference Optimization of LLMs,"Fine-tuning is integral for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy. More thought-provokingly, however, we find that single-reference DPO, using any of 6 out of 7 references, consistently outperforms all tested multiple-reference approaches -- calling into question the practical appeal of multiple-reference approaches.",2025-12-10 19:45:20+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10040v1
DynaMate: An Autonomous Agent for Protein-Ligand Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"Force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for probing the structure, dynamics, and functions of biomolecular systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions. This automated framework paves the way toward standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for future biomolecular and drug design applications.",2025-12-10 19:40:51+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CE']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10034v1
Cluster-Dags as Powerful Background Knowledge For Causal Discovery,"Finding cause-effect relationships is of key importance in science. Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships. However, current methods face several challenges, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge about the system can aid causal discovery. In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively. Empirical evaluation on simulated data demonstrates that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their respective baselines without prior knowledge.",2025-12-10 19:39:22+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10032v1
ABBSPO: Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling and Symmetric Prior based Orientation Prediction for Detecting Aerial Image Objects,"Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.",2025-12-10 19:37:54+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10031v1
Exploring LLMs for Scientific Information Extraction Using The SciEx Framework,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently.

Closing the Train-Test Gap in World Models for Gradient-Based Planning,"World models paired with model predictive control (MPC) can be trained offline on large-scale datasets of expert trajectories and enable generalization to a wide range of planning tasks at inference time. Compared to traditional MPC procedures, which rely on slow search algorithms or on iteratively solving optimization problems exactly, gradient-based planning offers a computationally efficient alternative. However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models. At test time, our approach outperforms or matches the classical gradient-free cross-entropy method (CEM) across a variety of object manipulation and navigation tasks in 10% of the time budget.",2025-12-10 18:59:45+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09929v1
"HiF-VLA: Hindsight, Insight and Foresight through Motion Representation for Vision-Language-Action Models","Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently enabled robotic manipulation by grounding visual and linguistic cues into actions. However, most VLAs assume the Markov property, relying only on the current observation and thus suffering from temporal myopia that degrades long-horizon coherence. In this work, we view motion as a more compact and informative representation of temporal context and world dynamics, capturing inter-state changes while filtering static pixel-level noise. Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation. As a result, HiF-VLA surpasses strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks, while incurring negligible additional inference latency. Furthermore, HiF-VLA achieves substantial improvements in real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks, demonstrating its broad effectiveness in practical robotic settings.",2025-12-10 18:59:32+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09928v1
Token Expand-Merge: Training-Free Token Compression for Vision-Language-Action Models,"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets have emerged as powerful foundations for robotic perception and control. However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models.

LISN: Language-Instructed Social Navigation with VLM-based Controller Modulating,"Towards human-robot coexistence, socially aware navigation is significant for mobile robots. Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.

FALCON: Few-step Accurate Likelihoods for Continuous Flows,"Scalable sampling of molecular states in thermodynamic equilibrium is a long-standing challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators tackle this problem by pairing a generative model, capable of exact likelihood computation, with importance sampling to obtain consistent samples under the target distribution. Current Boltzmann Generators primarily use continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) trained with flow matching for efficient training of powerful models. However, likelihood calculation for these models is extremely costly, requiring thousands of function evaluations per sample, severely limiting their adoption. In this work, we propose Few-step Accurate Likelihoods for Continuous Flows (FALCON), a method which allows for few-step sampling with a likelihood accurate enough for importance sampling applications by introducing a hybrid training objective that encourages invertibility. We show FALCON outperforms state-of-the-art normalizing flow models for molecular Boltzmann sampling and is two orders of magnitude faster than the equivalently performing CNF model.",2025-12-10 18:47:25+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09914v1
Supervised learning pays attention,"In-context learning with attention enables large neural networks to make context-specific predictions by selectively focusing on relevant examples. Here, we adapt this idea to supervised learning procedures such as lasso regression and gradient boosting, for tabular data. Our goals are to (1) flexibly fit personalized models for each prediction point and (2) retain model simplicity and interpretability.
  Our method fits a local model for each test observation by weighting the training data according to attention, a supervised similarity measure that emphasizes features and interactions that are predictive of the outcome. Attention weighting allows the method to adapt to heterogeneous data in a data-driven way, without requiring cluster or similarity pre-specification. Further, our approach is uniquely interpretable: for each test observation, we identify which features are most predictive and which training observations are most relevant. We then show how to use attention weighting for time series and spatial data, and we present a method for adapting pretrained tree-based models to distributional shift using attention-weighted residual corrections. Across real and simulated datasets, attention weighting improves predictive performance while preserving interpretability, and theory shows that attention-weighting linear models attain lower mean squared error than the standard linear model under mixture-of-models data-generating processes with known subgroup structure.",2025-12-10 18:43:46+00:00,"['stat.ML', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09912v1

Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy.

Efficient Continual Learning in Neural Machine Translation: A Low-Rank Adaptation Approach,"Continual learning in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) faces the dual challenges of catastrophic forgetting and the high computational cost of retraining. This study establishes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient framework to address these challenges in dedicated NMT architectures. We first demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning adapts NMT models to new languages and domains with performance on par with full-parameter techniques, while utilizing only a fraction of the parameter space. Second, we propose an interactive adaptation method using a calibrated linear combination of LoRA modules. This approach functions as a gate-free mixture of experts, enabling real-time, user-controllable adjustments to domain and style without retraining. Finally, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a novel gradient-based regularization strategy specifically designed for low-rank decomposition matrices. Unlike methods that regularize the full parameter set, our approach weights the penalty on the low-rank updates using historical gradient information. Experimental results indicate that this strategy efficiently preserves prior domain knowledge while facilitating the acquisition of new tasks, offering a scalable paradigm for interactive and continual NMT.",2025-12-10 18:37:57+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09910v1
STACHE: Local Black-Box Explanations for Reinforcement Learning Policies,"Reinforcement learning agents often behave unexpectedly in sparse-reward or safety-critical environments, creating a strong need for reliable debugging and verification tools. In this paper, we propose STACHE, a comprehensive framework for generating local, black-box explanations for an agent's specific action within discrete Markov games. Our method produces a Composite Explanation consisting of two complementary components: (1) a Robustness Region, the connected neighborhood of states where the agent's action remains invariant, and (2) Minimal Counterfactuals, the smallest state perturbations required to alter that decision. By exploiting the structure of factored state spaces, we introduce an exact, search-based algorithm that circumvents the fidelity gaps of surrogate models. Empirical validation on Gymnasium environments demonstrates that our framework not only explains policy actions, but also effectively captures the evolution of policy logic during training - from erratic, unstable behavior to optimized, robust strategies - providing actionable insights into agent sensitivity and decision boundaries.",2025-12-10 18:37:28+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09909v1
"Bayesian Networks, Markov Networks, Moralisation, Triangulation: a Categorical Perspective","Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.",2025-12-10 18:36:30+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LO', 'math.CT']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09908v1
YOPO-Nav: Visual Navigation using 3DGS Graphs from One-Pass Videos,"Visual navigation has emerged as a practical alternative to traditional robotic navigation pipelines that rely on detailed mapping and path planning. However, constructing and maintaining 3D maps is often computationally expensive and memory-intensive. We address the problem of visual navigation when exploration videos of a large environment are available. The videos serve as a visual reference, allowing a robot to retrace the explored trajectories without relying on metric maps. Our proposed method, YOPO-Nav (You Only Pass Once), encodes an environment into a compact spatial representation composed of interconnected local 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. During navigation, the framework aligns the robot's current visual observation with this representation and predicts actions that guide it back toward the demonstrated trajectory. YOPO-Nav employs a hierarchical design: a visual place recognition (VPR) module provides coarse localization, while the local 3DGS models refine the goal and intermediate poses to generate control actions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the YOPO-Campus dataset, comprising 4 hours of egocentric video and robot controller inputs from over 6 km of human-teleoperated robot trajectories. We benchmark recent visual navigation methods on trajectories from YOPO-Campus using a Clearpath Jackal robot. Experimental results show YOPO-Nav provides excellent performance in image-goal navigation for real-world scenes on a physical robot. The dataset and code will be made publicly available for visual navigation and scene representation research.",2025-12-10 18:32:38+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.CV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09903v1
Visual Heading Prediction for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles,"The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is increasingly central to the development of intelligent autonomous systems for applications such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics. However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506° and a root mean squared error of 0.1957°, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs. Experimental evaluations achieve 95% accuracy in UGV detection. This work contributes a vision-based, infrastructure- independent solution that demonstrates strong potential for deployment in GPS/GNSS-denied environments, supporting reliable multi-agent coordination under realistic dynamic conditions. A demonstration video showcasing the system's real-time performance, including UGV detection, heading angle prediction, and UAV alignment under dynamic conditions, is available at: https://github.com/Kooroshraf/UAV-UGV-Integration",2025-12-10 18:27:37+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'cs.MA', 'eess.SY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09898v1
SCOPE: Language Models as One-Time Teacher for Hierarchical Planning in Text Environments,"Long-term planning in complex, text-based environments presents significant challenges due to open-ended action spaces, ambiguous observations, and sparse feedback. Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.",2025-12-10 18:26:14+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CL']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09897v1
Human-in-the-Loop and AI: Crowdsourcing Metadata Vocabulary for Materials Science,"Metadata vocabularies are essential for advancing FAIR and FARR data principles, but their development constrained by limited human resources and inconsistent standardization practices. This paper introduces MatSci-YAMZ, a platform that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and human-in-the-loop (HILT), including crowdsourcing, to support metadata vocabulary development. The paper reports on a proof-of-concept use case evaluating the AI-HILT model in materials science, a highly interdisciplinary domain Six (6) participants affiliated with the NSF Institute for Data-Driven Dynamical Design (ID4) engaged with the MatSci-YAMZ plaform over several weeks, contributing term definitions and providing examples to prompt the AI-definitions refinement. Nineteen (19) AI-generated definitions were successfully created, with iterative feedback loops demonstrating the feasibility of AI-HILT refinement. Findings confirm the feasibility AI-HILT model highlighting 1) a successful proof of concept, 2) alignment with FAIR and open-science principles, 3) a research protocol to guide future studies, and 4) the potential for scalability across domains.

Provably Learning from Modern Language Models via Low Logit Rank,"While modern language models and their inner workings are incredibly complex, recent work (Golowich, Liu & Shetty; 2025) has proposed a simple and potentially tractable abstraction for them through the observation that empirically, these language models all seem to have approximately low logit rank. Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.
  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models. Thus, our result gives what we believe is the first end-to-end learning guarantee for a generative model that plausibly captures modern language models.",2025-12-10 18:18:11+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.DS', 'stat.ML']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09892v1
Comparing AI Agents to Cybersecurity Professionals in Real-World Penetration Testing,"We present the first comprehensive evaluation of AI agents against human cybersecurity professionals in a live enterprise environment. We evaluate ten cybersecurity professionals alongside six existing AI agents and ARTEMIS, our new agent scaffold, on a large university network consisting of ~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets. ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants. We observe that AI agents offer advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost -- certain ARTEMIS variants cost $18/hour versus $60/hour for professional penetration testers. We also identify key capability gaps: AI agents exhibit higher false-positive rates and struggle with GUI-based tasks.",2025-12-10 18:12:29+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CR', 'cs.CY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09882v1
Benchmarking Document Parsers on Mathematical Formula Extraction from PDFs,"Correctly parsing mathematical formulas from PDFs is critical for training large language models and building scientific knowledge bases from academic literature, yet existing benchmarks either exclude formulas entirely or lack semantically-aware evaluation metrics. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities. Our findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting parsers for downstream applications and establish a robust, scalable methodology that enables reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality.

FlipLLM: Efficient Bit-Flip Attacks on Multimodal LLMs using Reinforcement Learning,"Generative Artificial Intelligence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (VLMs), exhibit state-of-the-art performance but remain vulnerable to hardware-based threats, specifically bit-flip attacks (BFAs). Existing BFA discovery methods lack generalizability and struggle to scale, often failing to analyze the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies of modern foundation models in a reasonable time. This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses. FlipLLM offers the first scalable and adaptive methodology for exploring the BFA vulnerability of both language and multimodal foundation models, paving the way for comprehensive hardware-security evaluation.",2025-12-10 17:58:18+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09872v1
MedForget: Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed for Medical AI,"Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical AI systems for clinical reasoning, diagnosis support, and report generation. However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the ""right to be forgotten"". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction. MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems.",2025-12-10 17:55:06+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09867v1
Simultaneous Tactile-Visual Perception for Learning Multimodal Robot Manipulation,"Robotic manipulation requires both rich multimodal perception and effective learning frameworks to handle complex real-world tasks. See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination. This work demonstrates that combining simultaneous multimodal perception with modern learning frameworks enables more precise, adaptable robotic manipulation.",2025-12-10 17:35:13+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.CV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09851v1

The bridge requires no changes to Basilisk's core and integrates seamlessly with ROS 2 nodes. We demonstrate its use in a leader-follower formation flying scenario using nonlinear model predictive control, deployed identically in both simulation and on the ATMOS planar microgravity testbed. This setup supports rapid development, hardware-in-the-loop testing, and seamless transition from simulation to hardware. The bridge offers a flexible and scalable platform for modular spacecraft autonomy and reproducible research workflows.",2025-12-10 17:13:24+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09833v1
Interpretation as Linear Transformation: A Cognitive-Geometric Model of Belief and Meaning,"This paper develops a geometric framework for modeling belief, motivation, and influence across cognitively heterogeneous agents. Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.
  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-""the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition""-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.
  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents.",2025-12-10 17:13:01+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.MA', 'cs.SI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09831v1

RIFT: A Scalable Methodology for LLM Accelerator Fault Assessment using Reinforcement Learning,"The massive scale of modern AI accelerators presents critical challenges to traditional fault assessment methodologies, which face prohibitive computational costs and provide poor coverage of critical failure modes. This paper introduces RIFT (Reinforcement Learning-guided Intelligent Fault Targeting), a scalable framework that automates the discovery of minimal, high-impact fault scenarios for efficient design-time fault assessment. RIFT transforms the complex search for worst-case faults into a sequential decision-making problem, combining hybrid sensitivity analysis for search space pruning with reinforcement learning to intelligently generate minimal, high-impact test suites. Evaluated on billion-parameter Large Language Model (LLM) workloads using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, RIFT achieves a \textbf{2.2$\times$} fault assessment speedup over evolutionary methods and reduces the required test vector volume by over \textbf{99\%} compared to random fault injection, all while achieving \textbf{superior fault coverage}. The proposed framework also provides actionable data to enable intelligent hardware protection strategies, demonstrating that RIFT-guided selective error correction code provides a \textbf{12.8$\times$} improvement in \textbf{cost-effectiveness} (coverage per unit area) compared to uniform triple modular redundancy protection.

Composing Concepts from Images and Videos via Concept-prompt Binding,"Visual concept composition, which aims to integrate different elements from images and videos into a single, coherent visual output, still falls short in accurately extracting complex concepts from visual inputs and flexibly combining concepts from both images and videos. We introduce Bind & Compose, a one-shot method that enables flexible visual concept composition by binding visual concepts with corresponding prompt tokens and composing the target prompt with bound tokens from various sources. It adopts a hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into corresponding prompt tokens for accurate decomposition of complex visual concepts. To improve concept-token binding accuracy, we design a Diversify-and-Absorb Mechanism that uses an extra absorbent token to eliminate the impact of concept-irrelevant details when training with diversified prompts. To enhance the compatibility between image and video concepts, we present a Temporal Disentanglement Strategy that decouples the training process of video concepts into two stages with a dual-branch binder structure for temporal modeling. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior concept consistency, prompt fidelity, and motion quality over existing approaches, opening up new possibilities for visual creativity.",2025-12-10 16:57:31+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.MM']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09824v1
CHEM: Estimating and Understanding Hallucinations in Deep Learning for Image Processing,"U-Net and other U-shaped architectures have achieved significant success in image deconvolution tasks. However, challenges have emerged, as these methods might generate unrealistic artifacts or hallucinations, which can interfere with analysis in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach for quantifying and comprehending hallucination artifacts to ensure trustworthy computer vision models. Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations. We test the proposed approach on the CANDELS astronomical image dataset with models such as U-Net, SwinUNet, and Learnlets, and provide new perspectives on hallucination from different aspects in deep learning-based image processing.",2025-12-10 16:20:00+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09806v1
High-Resolution Water Sampling via a Solar-Powered Autonomous Surface Vehicle,"Accurate water quality assessment requires spatially resolved sampling, yet most unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) can collect only a limited number of samples or rely on single-point sensors with poor representativeness. This work presents a solar-powered, fully autonomous USV featuring a novel syringe-based sampling architecture capable of acquiring 72 discrete, contamination-minimized water samples per mission. The vehicle incorporates a ROS 2 autonomy stack with GPS-RTK navigation, LiDAR and stereo-vision obstacle detection, Nav2-based mission planning, and long-range LoRa supervision, enabling dependable execution of sampling routes in unstructured environments. The platform integrates a behavior-tree autonomy architecture adapted from Nav2, enabling mission-level reasoning and perception-aware navigation. A modular 6x12 sampling system, controlled by distributed micro-ROS nodes, provides deterministic actuation, fault isolation, and rapid module replacement, achieving spatial coverage beyond previously reported USV-based samplers. Field trials in Achocalla Lagoon (La Paz, Bolivia) demonstrated 87% waypoint accuracy, stable autonomous navigation, and accurate physicochemical measurements (temperature, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids) comparable to manually collected references.

PathCo-LatticE: Pathology-Constrained Lattice-Of Experts Framework for Fully-supervised Few-Shot Cardiac MRI Segmentation,"Few-shot learning (FSL) mitigates data scarcity in cardiac MRI segmentation but typically relies on semi-supervised techniques sensitive to domain shifts and validation bias, restricting zero-shot generalizability. We propose PathCo-LatticE, a fully supervised FSL framework that replaces unlabeled data with pathology-guided synthetic supervision. First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data. Finally, a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts (LoE) organizes specialized networks within a pathology-aware topology and activates the most relevant experts per input, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to unseen data without target-domain fine-tuning. We evaluated PathCo-LatticE in a strict out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, deriving all anchors and severity statistics from a single-source domain (ACDC) and performing zero-shot testing on the multi-center, multi-vendor M&Ms dataset. PathCo-LatticE outperforms four state-of-the-art FSL methods by 4.2-11% Dice starting from only 7 labeled anchors, and approaches fully supervised performance (within 1% Dice) with only 19 labeled anchors. The method shows superior harmonization across four vendors and generalization to unseen pathologies.

Quantifying Uncertainty in Machine Learning-Based Pervasive Systems: Application to Human Activity Recognition,"The recent convergence of pervasive computing and machine learning has given rise to numerous services, impacting almost all areas of economic and social activity. However, the use of AI techniques precludes certain standard software development practices, which emphasize rigorous testing to ensure the elimination of all bugs and adherence to well-defined specifications. ML models are trained on numerous high-dimensional examples rather than being manually coded. Consequently, the boundaries of their operating range are uncertain, and they cannot guarantee absolute error-free performance. In this paper, we propose to quantify uncertainty in ML-based systems. To achieve this, we propose to adapt and jointly utilize a set of selected techniques to evaluate the relevance of model predictions at runtime. We apply and evaluate these proposals in the highly heterogeneous and evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

Weird Generalization and Inductive Backdoors: New Ways to Corrupt LLMs,"LLMs are useful because they generalize so well. But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. ""Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner""). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors. Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data.",2025-12-10 15:21:41+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CR', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09742v1
Analyzing Planner Design Trade-offs for MAPF under Realistic Simulation,"Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms are increasingly deployed in industrial warehouses and automated manufacturing facilities, where robots must operate reliably under real-world physical constraints. However, existing MAPF evaluation frameworks typically rely on simplified robot models, leaving a substantial gap between algorithmic benchmarks and practical performance. Recent frameworks such as SMART, incorporate kinodynamic modeling and offer the MAPF community a platform for large-scale, realistic evaluation. Building on this capability, this work investigates how key planner design choices influence performance under realistic execution settings. We systematically study three fundamental factors: (1) the relationship between solution optimality and execution performance, (2) the sensitivity of system performance to inaccuracies in kinodynamic modeling, and (3) the interaction between model accuracy and plan optimality. Empirically, we examine these factors to understand how these design choices affect performance in realistic scenarios.

The Ky Fan Norms and Beyond: Dual Norms and Combinations for Matrix Optimization,"In this article, we explore the use of various matrix norms for optimizing functions of weight matrices, a crucial problem in training large language models. Moving beyond the spectral norm underlying the Muon update, we leverage duals of the Ky Fan $k$-norms to introduce a family of Muon-like algorithms we name Fanions, which are closely related to Dion. By working with duals of convex combinations of the Ky Fan $k$-norms with either the Frobenius norm or the $l_\infty$ norm, we construct the families of F-Fanions and S-Fanions, respectively. Their most prominent members are F-Muon and S-Muon. We complement our theoretical analysis with an extensive empirical study of these algorithms across a wide range of tasks and settings, demonstrating that F-Muon and S-Muon consistently match Muon's performance, while outperforming vanilla Muon on a synthetic linear least squares problem.",2025-12-10 14:25:45+00:00,"['math.OC', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09678v1
Drawback of Enforcing Equivariance and its Compensation via the Lens of Expressive Power,"Equivariant neural networks encode symmetry as an inductive bias and have achieved strong empirical performance in wide domains. However, their expressive power remains not well understood. Focusing on 2-layer ReLU networks, this paper investigates the impact of equivariance constraints on the expressivity of equivariant and layer-wise equivariant networks. By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power. However, we demonstrate that this drawback can be compensated via enlarging the model size. Furthermore, we show that despite a larger model size, the resulting architecture could still correspond to a hypothesis space with lower complexity, implying superior generalizability for equivariant networks.",2025-12-10 14:18:59+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.NE', 'stat.ML']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09673v1
Can LLMs Evaluate What They Cannot Annotate? Revisiting LLM Reliability in Hate Speech Detection,"Hate speech spreads widely online, harming individuals and communities, making automatic detection essential for large-scale moderation, yet detecting it remains difficult. Part of the challenge lies in subjectivity: what one person flags as hate speech, another may see as benign. Traditional annotation agreement metrics, such as Cohen's $κ$, oversimplify this disagreement, treating it as an error rather than meaningful diversity. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise scalable annotation, but prior studies demonstrate that they cannot fully replace human judgement, especially in subjective tasks. In this work, we reexamine LLM reliability using a subjectivity-aware framework, cross-Rater Reliability (xRR), revealing that even under fairer lens, LLMs still diverge from humans. Yet this limitation opens an opportunity: we find that LLM-generated annotations can reliably reflect performance trends across classification models, correlating with human evaluations. We test this by examining whether LLM-generated annotations preserve the relative ordering of model performance derived from human evaluation (i.e. whether models ranked as more reliable by human annotators preserve the same order when evaluated with LLM-generated labels). Our results show that, although LLMs differ from humans at the instance level, they reproduce similar ranking and classification patterns, suggesting their potential as proxy evaluators. While not a substitute for human annotators, they might serve as a scalable proxy for evaluation in subjective NLP tasks.",2025-12-10 14:00:48+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09662v1
ReMoSPLAT: Reactive Mobile Manipulation Control on a Gaussian Splat,"Reactive control can gracefully coordinate the motion of the base and the arm of a mobile manipulator. However, incorporating an accurate representation of the environment to avoid obstacles without involving costly planning remains a challenge. In this work, we present ReMoSPLAT, a reactive controller based on a quadratic program formulation for mobile manipulation that leverages a Gaussian Splat representation for collision avoidance. By integrating additional constraints and costs into the optimisation formulation, a mobile manipulator platform can reach its intended end effector pose while avoiding obstacles, even in cluttered scenes. We investigate the trade-offs of two methods for efficiently calculating robot-obstacle distances, comparing a purely geometric approach with a rasterisation-based approach. Our experiments in simulation on both synthetic and real-world scans demonstrate the feasibility of our method, showing that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to controllers that rely on perfect ground-truth information.",2025-12-10 13:52:08+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09656v1
An End-to-end Planning Framework with Agentic LLMs and PDDL,"We present an end-to-end framework for planning supported by verifiers. An orchestrator receives a human specification written in natural language and converts it into a PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) model, where the domain and problem are iteratively refined by sub-modules (agents) to address common planning requirements, such as time constraints and optimality, as well as ambiguities and contradictions that may exist in the human specification. The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process. Finally, a module translates the final plan back into natural language to improve human readability while maintaining the correctness of each step. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across various domains and tasks, including the Google NaturalPlan benchmark and PlanBench, as well as planning problems like Blocksworld and the Tower of Hanoi (where LLMs are known to struggle even with small instances). Our framework can be integrated with any PDDL planning engine and validator (such as Fast Downward, LPG, POPF, VAL, and uVAL, which we have tested) and represents a significant step toward end-to-end planning aided by LLMs.",2025-12-10 13:17:08+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09629v1
GLaD: Geometric Latent Distillation for Vision-Language-Action Models,"Most existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely primarily on RGB information, while ignoring geometric cues crucial for spatial reasoning and manipulation. In this work, we introduce GLaD, a geometry-aware VLA framework that incorporates 3D geometric priors during pretraining through knowledge distillation. Rather than distilling geometric features solely into the vision encoder, we align the LLM's hidden states corresponding to visual tokens with features from a frozen geometry-aware vision transformer (VGGT), ensuring that geometric understanding is deeply integrated into the multimodal representations that drive action prediction. Pretrained on the Bridge dataset with this geometry distillation mechanism, GLaD achieves 94.1% average success rate across four LIBERO task suites, outperforming UniVLA (92.5%) which uses identical pretraining data. These results validate that geometry-aware pretraining enhances spatial reasoning and policy generalization without requiring explicit depth sensors or 3D annotations.",2025-12-10 13:07:27+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09619v1
Rethinking Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Videos,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been highly successful in solving complex tasks in natural language processing, and recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended this paradigm to video reasoning. However, these models typically build on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of input visual tokens. Motivated by empirical observations from our benchmark study, we hypothesize that concise reasoning combined with a reduced set of visual tokens can be sufficient for effective video reasoning. To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient. Our code will be released at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/Rethink_CoT_Video.",2025-12-10 13:05:55+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09616v1
ImageTalk: Designing a Multimodal AAC Text Generation System Driven by Image Recognition and Natural Language Generation,"People living with Motor Neuron Disease (plwMND) frequently encounter speech and motor impairments that necessitate a reliance on augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. This paper tackles the main challenge that traditional symbol-based AAC systems offer a limited vocabulary, while text entry solutions tend to exhibit low communication rates. To help plwMND articulate their needs about the system efficiently and effectively, we iteratively design and develop a novel multimodal text generation system called ImageTalk through a tailored proxy-user-based and an end-user-based design phase. The system demonstrates pronounced keystroke savings of 95.6%, coupled with consistent performance and high user satisfaction. We distill three design guidelines for AI-assisted text generation systems design and outline four user requirement levels tailored for AAC purposes, guiding future research in this field.",2025-12-10 12:57:55+00:00,"['cs.HC', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09610v1
Super4DR: 4D Radar-centric Self-supervised Odometry and Gaussian-based Map Optimization,"Conventional SLAM systems using visual or LiDAR data often struggle in poor lighting and severe weather. Although 4D radar is suited for such environments, its sparse and noisy point clouds hinder accurate odometry estimation, while the radar maps suffer from obscure and incomplete structures. Thus, we propose Super4DR, a 4D radar-centric framework for learning-based odometry estimation and gaussian-based map optimization. First, we design a cluster-aware odometry network that incorporates object-level cues from the clustered radar points for inter-frame matching, alongside a hierarchical self-supervision mechanism to overcome outliers through spatio-temporal consistency, knowledge transfer, and feature contrast. Second, we propose using 3D gaussians as an intermediate representation, coupled with a radar-specific growth strategy, selective separation, and multi-view regularization, to recover blurry map areas and those undetected based on image texture. Experiments show that Super4DR achieves a 67% performance gain over prior self-supervised methods, nearly matches supervised odometry, and narrows the map quality disparity with LiDAR while enabling multi-modal image rendering.",2025-12-10 12:55:05+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09608v1
UrbanNav: Learning Language-Guided Urban Navigation from Web-Scale Human Trajectories,"Navigating complex urban environments using natural language instructions poses significant challenges for embodied agents, including noisy language instructions, ambiguous spatial references, diverse landmarks, and dynamic street scenes. Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings. Experimental results show that UrbanNav significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of large-scale web video data to enable language-guided, real-world urban navigation for embodied agents.",2025-12-10 12:54:04+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.CV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09607v1
CS3D: An Efficient Facial Expression Recognition via Event Vision,"Responsive and accurate facial expression recognition is crucial to human-robot interaction for daily service robots. Nowadays, event cameras are becoming more widely adopted as they surpass RGB cameras in capturing facial expression changes due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, computational efficiency, and robustness in low-light conditions. Despite these advantages, event-based approaches still encounter practical challenges, particularly in adopting mainstream deep learning models. Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CS3D method attains higher accuracy on multiple datasets compared to architectures such as the RNN, Transformer, and C3D, while the energy consumption of the CS3D method is just 21.97\% of the original C3D required on the same device.",2025-12-10 12:42:28+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09592v1
Stanford Sleep Bench: Evaluating Polysomnography Pre-training Methods for Sleep Foundation Models,"Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard test for sleep analysis, generates vast amounts of multimodal clinical data, presenting an opportunity to leverage self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) for pre-training foundation models to enhance sleep analysis. However, progress in sleep foundation models is hindered by two key limitations: (1) the lack of a shared dataset and benchmark with diverse tasks for training and evaluation, and (2) the absence of a systematic evaluation of SSRL approaches across sleep-related tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. However, for mortality and disease prediction, contrastive learning significantly outperforms other approaches while also converging faster during pretraining. To facilitate reproducibility and advance sleep research, we will release Stanford Sleep Bench along with pretrained model weights, training pipelines, and evaluation code.",2025-12-10 12:37:29+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09591v1
Graph-Based Bayesian Optimization for Quantum Circuit Architecture Search with Uncertainty Calibrated Surrogates,"Quantum circuit design is a key bottleneck for practical quantum machine learning on complex, real-world data. We present an automated framework that discovers and refines variational quantum circuits (VQCs) using graph-based Bayesian optimization with a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate. Circuits are represented as graphs and mutated and selected via an expected improvement acquisition function informed by surrogate uncertainty with Monte Carlo dropout. Candidate circuits are evaluated with a hybrid quantum-classical variational classifier on the next generation firewall telemetry and network internet of things (NF-ToN-IoT-V2) cybersecurity dataset, after feature selection and scaling for quantum embedding. We benchmark our pipeline against an MLP-based surrogate, random search, and greedy GNN selection. The GNN-guided optimizer consistently finds circuits with lower complexity and competitive or superior classification accuracy compared to all baselines. Robustness is assessed via a noise study across standard quantum noise channels, including amplitude damping, phase damping, thermal relaxation, depolarizing, and readout bit flip noise. The implementation is fully reproducible, with time benchmarking and export of best found circuits, providing a scalable and interpretable route to automated quantum circuit discovery.",2025-12-10 12:23:04+00:00,"['quant-ph', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE', 'cs.NI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09586v1
Hands-on Evaluation of Visual Transformers for Object Recognition and Detection,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision sometimes struggle with understanding images in a global context, as they mainly focus on local patterns. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging.",2025-12-10 12:15:48+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09579v1

Lazy Diffusion: Mitigating spectral collapse in generative diffusion-based stable autoregressive emulation of turbulent flows,"Turbulent flows posses broadband, power-law spectra in which multiscale interactions couple high-wavenumber fluctuations to large-scale dynamics. Although diffusion-based generative models offer a principled probabilistic forecasting framework, we show that standard DDPMs induce a fundamental \emph{spectral collapse}: a Fourier-space analysis of the forward SDE reveals a closed-form, mode-wise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that decays monotonically in wavenumber, $|k|$ for spectra $S(k)\!\propto\!|k|^{-λ}$, rendering high-wavenumber modes indistinguishable from noise and producing an intrinsic spectral bias. We reinterpret the noise schedule as a spectral regularizer and introduce power-law schedules $β(τ)\!\propto\!τ^γ$ that preserve fine-scale structure deeper into diffusion time, along with \emph{Lazy Diffusion}, a one-step distillation method that leverages the learned score geometry to bypass long reverse-time trajectories and prevent high-$k$ degradation. Applied to high-Reynolds-number 2D Kolmogorov turbulence and $1/12^\circ$ Gulf of Mexico ocean reanalysis, these methods resolve spectral collapse, stabilize long-horizon autoregression, and restore physically realistic inertial-range scaling. Together, they show that naïve Gaussian scheduling is structurally incompatible with power-law physics and that physics-aware diffusion processes can yield accurate, efficient, and fully probabilistic surrogates for multiscale dynamical systems.",2025-12-10 12:05:32+00:00,"['physics.flu-dyn', 'cs.AI', 'math.DS', 'nlin.CD', 'physics.ao-ph']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09572v1
"Mastering Diverse, Unknown, and Cluttered Tracks for Robust Vision-Based Drone Racing","Most reinforcement learning(RL)-based methods for drone racing target fixed, obstacle-free tracks, leaving the generalization to unknown, cluttered environments largely unaddressed. This challenge stems from the need to balance racing speed and collision avoidance, limited feasible space causing policy exploration trapped in local optima during training, and perceptual ambiguity between gates and obstacles in depth maps-especially when gate positions are only coarsely specified. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-phase learning framework: an initial soft-collision training phase that preserves policy exploration for high-speed flight, followed by a hard-collision refinement phase that enforces robust obstacle avoidance. An adaptive, noise-augmented curriculum with an asymmetric actor-critic architecture gradually shifts the policy's reliance from privileged gate-state information to depth-based visual input. We further impose Lipschitz constraints and integrate a track-primitive generator to enhance motion stability and cross-environment generalization. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulation and ablation studies, and validate it in real-world experiments on a computationally constrained quadrotor. The system achieves agile flight while remaining robust to gate-position errors, developing a generalizable drone racing framework with the capability to operate in diverse, partially unknown and cluttered environments. https://yufengsjtu.github.io/MasterRacing.github.io/",2025-12-10 12:02:48+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09571v2
The Gender Code: Gendering the Global Governance of Artificial Intelligence,"This paper examines how international AI governance frameworks address gender issues and gender-based harms. The analysis covers binding regulations, such as the EU AI Act; soft law instruments, like the UNESCO Recommendations on AI Ethics; and global initiatives, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). These instruments reveal emerging trends, including the integration of gender concerns into broader human rights frameworks, a shift toward explicit gender-related provisions, and a growing emphasis on inclusivity and diversity. Yet, some critical gaps persist, including inconsistent treatment of gender across governance documents, limited engagement with intersectionality, and a lack of robust enforcement mechanisms. However, this paper argues that effective AI governance must be intersectional, enforceable, and inclusive. This is key to moving beyond tokenism toward meaningful equity and preventing reinforcement of existing inequalities. The study contributes to ethical AI debates by highlighting the importance of gender-sensitive governance in building a just technological future.",2025-12-10 12:02:47+00:00,"['cs.CY', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09570v1
"Toward Closed-loop Molecular Discovery via Language Model, Property Alignment and Strategic Search","Drug discovery is a time-consuming and expensive process, with traditional high-throughput and docking-based virtual screening hampered by low success rates and limited scalability. Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold.",2025-12-10 11:59:42+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09566v1

SWEnergy: An Empirical Study on Energy Efficiency in Agentic Issue Resolution Frameworks with SLMs,"Context. LLM-based autonomous agents in software engineering rely on large, proprietary models, limiting local deployment. This has spurred interest in Small Language Models (SLMs), but their practical effectiveness and efficiency within complex agentic frameworks for automated issue resolution remain poorly understood.
  Goal. We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs. We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs.
  Method. We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark. On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration.
  Results. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption. The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma). However, this energy is largely wasted. Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops. The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency.
  Conclusions. Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning. Viable low-energy solutions require shifting from passive orchestration to architectures that actively manage SLM weaknesses.",2025-12-10 11:28:48+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09543v2
REASAN: Learning Reactive Safe Navigation for Legged Robots,"We present a novel modularized end-to-end framework for legged reactive navigation in complex dynamic environments using a single light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor.

NeuroSketch: An Effective Framework for Neural Decoding via Systematic Architectural Optimization,"Neural decoding, a critical component of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), has recently attracted increasing research interest. Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, the in-depth exploration of model architectures remains underexplored, despite its proven effectiveness in other tasks such as energy forecasting and image classification. In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks. Experimental results indicate that NeuroSketch achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all evaluated datasets, positioning it as a powerful tool for neural decoding.

Representation Invariance and Allocation: When Subgroup Balance Matters,"Unequal representation of demographic groups in training data poses challenges to model generalisation across populations. Standard practice assumes that balancing subgroup representation optimises performance. However, recent empirical results contradict this assumption: in some cases, imbalanced data distributions actually improve subgroup performance, while in others, subgroup performance remains unaffected by the absence of an entire subgroup during training. We conduct a systematic study of subgroup allocation across four vision and language models, varying training data composition to characterise the sensitivity of subgroup performance to data balance. We propose the latent separation hypothesis, which states that a partially fine-tuned model's dependence on subgroup representation is determined by the degree of separation between subgroups in the latent space of the pre-trained model. We formalise this hypothesis, provide theoretical analysis, and validate it empirically. Finally, we present a practical application to foundation model fine-tuning, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of latent subgroup separation can inform data collection and balancing decisions.",2025-12-10 10:19:48+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09496v1
On Mobile Ad Hoc Networks for Coverage of Partially Observable Worlds,"This paper addresses the movement and placement of mobile agents to establish a communication network in initially unknown environments. We cast the problem in a computational-geometric framework by relating the coverage problem and line-of-sight constraints to the Cooperative Guard Art Gallery Problem, and introduce its partially observable variant, the Partially Observable Cooperative Guard Art Gallery Problem (POCGAGP). We then present two algorithms that solve POCGAGP: CADENCE, a centralized planner that incrementally selects 270 degree corners at which to deploy agents, and DADENCE, a decentralized scheme that coordinates agents using local information and lightweight messaging. Both approaches operate under partial observability and target simultaneous coverage and connectivity. We evaluate the methods in simulation across 1,500 test cases of varied size and structure, demonstrating consistent success in forming connected networks while covering and exploring unknown space. These results highlight the value of geometric abstractions for communication-driven exploration and show that decentralized policies are competitive with centralized performance while retaining scalability.",2025-12-10 10:19:34+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.CG', 'cs.MA']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09495v1
RouteRAG: Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation from Text and Graph via Reinforcement Learning,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates non-parametric knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), typically from unstructured texts and structured graphs. While recent progress has advanced text-based RAG to multi-turn reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), extending these advances to hybrid retrieval introduces additional challenges. Existing graph-based or hybrid systems typically depend on fixed or handcrafted retrieval pipelines, lacking the ability to integrate supplementary evidence as reasoning unfolds. Besides, while graph evidence provides relational structures crucial for multi-hop reasoning, it is substantially more expensive to retrieve. To address these limitations, we introduce \model{}, an RL-based framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-turn and adaptive graph-text hybrid RAG. \model{} jointly optimizes the entire generation process via RL, allowing the model to learn when to reason, what to retrieve from either texts or graphs, and when to produce final answers, all within a unified generation policy. To guide this learning process, we design a two-stage training framework that accounts for both task outcome and retrieval efficiency, enabling the model to exploit hybrid evidence while avoiding unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experimental results across five question answering benchmarks demonstrate that \model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, highlighting the benefits of end-to-end RL in supporting adaptive and efficient retrieval for complex reasoning.",2025-12-10 10:05:31+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.IR']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09487v1
Advancing LLM-Based Security Automation with Customized Group Relative Policy Optimization for Zero-Touch Networks,"Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs) represent a transformative paradigm toward fully automated and intelligent network management, providing the scalability and adaptability required for the complexity of sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, the distributed architecture, high openness, and deep heterogeneity of 6G networks expand the attack surface and pose unprecedented security challenges. To address this, security automation aims to enable intelligent security management across dynamic and complex environments, serving as a key capability for securing 6G ZTNs. Despite its promise, implementing security automation in 6G ZTNs presents two primary challenges: 1) automating the lifecycle from security strategy generation to validation and update under real-world, parallel, and adversarial conditions, and 2) adapting security strategies to evolving threats and dynamic environments. This motivates us to propose SecLoop and SA-GRPO. SecLoop constitutes the first fully automated framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) across the entire lifecycle of security strategy generation, orchestration, response, and feedback, enabling intelligent and adaptive defenses in dynamic network environments, thus tackling the first challenge. Furthermore, we propose SA-GRPO, a novel security-aware group relative policy optimization algorithm that iteratively refines security strategies by contrasting group feedback collected from parallel SecLoop executions, thereby addressing the second challenge. Extensive real-world experiments on five benchmarks, including 11 MITRE ATT&CK processes and over 20 types of attacks, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SecLoop and SA-GRPO. We will release our platform to the community, facilitating the advancement of security automation towards next generation communications.",2025-12-10 10:04:11+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09485v1
Color encoding in Latent Space of Stable Diffusion Models,"Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, yet a detailed understanding of how specific perceptual attributes - such as color and shape - are internally represented remains limited. This work explores how color is encoded in a generative model through a systematic analysis of the latent representations in Stable Diffusion. Through controlled synthetic datasets, principal component analysis (PCA) and similarity metrics, we reveal that color information is encoded along circular, opponent axes predominantly captured in latent channels c_3 and c_4, whereas intensity and shape are primarily represented in channels c_1 and c_2. Our findings indicate that the latent space of Stable Diffusion exhibits an interpretable structure aligned with a efficient coding representation. These insights provide a foundation for future work in model understanding, editing applications, and the design of more disentangled generative frameworks.",2025-12-10 09:54:03+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09477v1
Temporal-Spatial Tubelet Embedding for Cloud-Robust MSI Reconstruction using MSI-SAR Fusion: A Multi-Head Self-Attention Video Vision Transformer Approach,"Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) significantly hinders early-season crop mapping by corrupting spectral information. Existing Vision Transformer(ViT)-based time-series reconstruction methods, like SMTS-ViT, often employ coarse temporal embeddings that aggregate entire sequences, causing substantial information loss and reducing reconstruction accuracy. To address these limitations, a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)-based framework with temporal-spatial fusion embedding for MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered regions is proposed in this study. Non-overlapping tubelets are extracted via 3D convolution with constrained temporal span $(t=2)$, ensuring local temporal coherence while reducing cross-day information degradation. Both MSI-only and SAR-MSI fusion scenarios are considered during the experiments. Comprehensive experiments on 2020 Traill County data demonstrate notable performance improvements: MTS-ViViT achieves a 2.23\% reduction in MSE compared to the MTS-ViT baseline, while SMTS-ViViT achieves a 10.33\% improvement with SAR integration over the SMTS-ViT baseline. The proposed framework effectively enhances spectral reconstruction quality for robust agricultural monitoring.",2025-12-10 09:46:08+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09471v1
Privacy-Preserving Computer Vision for Industry: Three Case Studies in Human-Centric Manufacturing,"The adoption of AI-powered computer vision in industry is often constrained by the need to balance operational utility with worker privacy. Building on our previously proposed privacy-preserving framework, this paper presents its first comprehensive validation on real-world data collected directly by industrial partners in active production environments. We evaluate the framework across three representative use cases: woodworking production monitoring, human-aware AGV navigation, and multi-camera ergonomic risk assessment. The approach employs learned visual transformations that obscure sensitive or task-irrelevant information while retaining features essential for task performance. Through both quantitative evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off and qualitative feedback from industrial partners, we assess the framework's effectiveness, deployment feasibility, and trust implications. Results demonstrate that task-specific obfuscation enables effective monitoring with reduced privacy risks, establishing the framework's readiness for real-world adoption and providing cross-domain recommendations for responsible, human-centric AI deployment in industry.",2025-12-10 09:33:03+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09463v1
Development of a Compliant Gripper for Safe Robot-Assisted Trouser Dressing-Undressing,"In recent years, many countries, including Japan, have rapidly aging populations, making the preservation of seniors' quality of life a significant concern. For elderly people with impaired physical abilities, support for toileting is one of the most important issues. This paper details the design, development, experimental assessment, and potential application of the gripper system, with a focus on the unique requirements and obstacles involved in aiding elderly or hemiplegic individuals in dressing and undressing trousers. The gripper we propose seeks to find the right balance between compliance and grasping forces, ensuring precise manipulation while maintaining a safe and compliant interaction with the users. The gripper's integration into a custom--built robotic manipulator system provides a comprehensive solution for assisting hemiplegic individuals in their dressing and undressing tasks. Experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing studies demonstrate the gripper's ability to successfully assist in both dressing and dressing of trousers in confined spaces with a high success rate. This research contributes to the advancement of assistive robotics, empowering elderly, and physically impaired individuals to maintain their independence and improve their quality of life.",2025-12-10 09:30:36+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09462v1
Cytoplasmic Strings Analysis in Human Embryo Time-Lapse Videos using Deep Learning Framework,"Infertility is a major global health issue, and while in-vitro fertilization has improved treatment outcomes, embryo selection remains a critical bottleneck. Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

Architectures for Building Agentic AI,"This chapter argues that the reliability of agentic and generative AI is chiefly an architectural property. We define agentic systems as goal-directed, tool-using decision makers operating in closed loops, and show how reliability emerges from principled componentisation (goal manager, planner, tool-router, executor, memory, verifiers, safety monitor, telemetry), disciplined interfaces (schema-constrained, validated, least-privilege tool calls), and explicit control and assurance loops. Building on classical foundations, we propose a practical taxonomy-tool-using agents, memory-augmented agents, planning and self-improvement agents, multi-agent systems, and embodied or web agents - and analyse how each pattern reshapes the reliability envelope and failure modes. We distil design guidance on typed schemas, idempotency, permissioning, transactional semantics, memory provenance and hygiene, runtime governance (budgets, termination conditions), and simulate-before-actuate safeguards.",2025-12-10 09:28:40+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09458v1
Sequential Testing for Descriptor-Agnostic LiDAR Loop Closure in Repetitive Environments,"We propose a descriptor-agnostic, multi-frame loop closure verification method that formulates LiDAR loop closure as a truncated Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). Instead of deciding from a single descriptor comparison or using fixed thresholds with late-stage Iterative Closest Point (ICP) vetting, the verifier accumulates a short temporal stream of descriptor similarities between a query and each candidate. It then issues an accept/reject decision adaptively once sufficient multi-frame evidence has been observed, according to user-specified Type-I/II error design targets. This precision-first policy is designed to suppress false positives in structurally repetitive indoor environments. We evaluate the verifier on a five-sequence library dataset, using a fixed retrieval front-end with several representative LiDAR global descriptors. Performance is assessed via segment-level K-hit precision-recall and absolute trajectory error (ATE) and relative pose error (RPE) after pose graph optimization. Across descriptors, the sequential verifier consistently improves precision and reduces the impact of aliased loops compared with single-frame and heuristic multi-frame baselines.

Advancing Mathematical Research via Human-AI Interactive Theorem Proving,"We investigate how large language models can be used as research tools in scientific computing while preserving mathematical rigor. We propose a human-in-the-loop workflow for interactive theorem proving and discovery with LLMs. Human experts retain control over problem formulation and admissible assumptions, while the model searches for proofs or contradictions, proposes candidate properties and theorems, and helps construct structures and parameters that satisfy explicit constraints, supported by numerical experiments and simple verification checks. Experts treat these outputs as raw material, further refine them, and organize the results into precise statements and rigorous proofs. We instantiate this workflow in a case study on the connection between manifold optimization and Grover's quantum search algorithm, where the pipeline helps identify invariant subspaces, explore Grover-compatible retractions, and obtain convergence guarantees for the retraction-based gradient method. The framework provides a practical template for integrating large language models into frontier mathematical research, enabling faster exploration of proof space and algorithm design while maintaining transparent reasoning responsibilities. Although illustrated on manifold optimization problems in quantum computing, the principles extend to other core areas of scientific computing.",2025-12-10 09:16:27+00:00,"['cs.HC', 'cs.AI', 'math.OC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09443v2
Representation Calibration and Uncertainty Guidance for Class-Incremental Learning based on Vision Language Model,"Class-incremental learning requires a learning system to continually learn knowledge of new classes and meanwhile try to preserve previously learned knowledge of old classes. As current state-of-the-art methods based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still suffer from the issue of differentiating classes across learning tasks. Here a novel VLM-based continual learning framework for image classification is proposed. In this framework, task-specific adapters are added to the pre-trained and frozen image encoder to learn new knowledge, and a novel cross-task representation calibration strategy based on a mixture of light-weight projectors is used to help better separate all learned classes in a unified feature space, alleviating class confusion across tasks. In addition, a novel inference strategy guided by prediction uncertainty is developed to more accurately select the most appropriate image feature for class prediction.

CourtPressGER: A German Court Decision to Press Release Summarization Dataset,"Official court press releases from Germany's highest courts present and explain judicial rulings to the public, as well as to expert audiences. Prior NLP efforts emphasize technical headnotes, ignoring citizen-oriented communication needs. We introduce CourtPressGER, a 6.4k dataset of triples: rulings, human-drafted press releases, and synthetic prompts for LLMs to generate comparable releases. This benchmark trains and evaluates LLMs in generating accurate, readable summaries from long judicial texts. We benchmark small and large LLMs using reference-based metrics, factual-consistency checks, LLM-as-judge, and expert ranking. Large LLMs produce high-quality drafts with minimal hierarchical performance loss; smaller models require hierarchical setups for long judgments. Initial benchmarks show varying model performance, with human-drafted releases ranking highest.",2025-12-10 09:04:00+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09434v1
"A Hierarchical, Model-Based System for High-Performance Humanoid Soccer","The development of athletic humanoid robots has gained significant attention as advances in actuation, sensing, and control enable increasingly dynamic, real-world capabilities. RoboCup, an international competition of fully autonomous humanoid robots, provides a uniquely challenging benchmark for such systems, culminating in the long-term goal of competing against human soccer players by 2050. This paper presents the hardware and software innovations underlying our team's victory in the RoboCup 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer Competition. On the hardware side, we introduce an adult-sized humanoid platform built with lightweight structural components, high-torque quasi-direct-drive actuators, and a specialized foot design that enables powerful in-gait kicks while preserving locomotion robustness. On the software side, we develop an integrated perception and localization framework that combines stereo vision, object detection, and landmark-based fusion to provide reliable estimates of the ball, goals, teammates, and opponents. A mid-level navigation stack then generates collision-aware, dynamically feasible trajectories, while a centralized behavior manager coordinates high-level decision making, role selection, and kick execution based on the evolving game state. The seamless integration of these subsystems results in fast, precise, and tactically effective gameplay, enabling robust performance under the dynamic and adversarial conditions of real matches. This paper presents the design principles, system architecture, and experimental results that contributed to ARTEMIS's success as the 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer champion.",2025-12-10 08:58:37+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09431v1
ODMA: On-Demand Memory Allocation Framework for LLM Serving on LPDDR-Class Accelerators,"Serving large language models (LLMs) on accelerators with poor random-access bandwidth (e.g., LPDDR5-based) is limited by current memory managers. Static pre-allocation wastes memory, while fine-grained paging (e.g., PagedAttention) is ill-suited due to high random-access costs. Existing HBM-centric solutions do not exploit the characteristics of random-access-constrained memory (RACM) accelerators like Cambricon MLU370. We present ODMA, an on-demand memory allocation framework for RACM. ODMA addresses distribution drift and heavy-tailed requests by coupling a lightweight length predictor with dynamic bucket partitioning and a large-bucket safeguard. Boundaries are periodically updated from live traces to maximize utilization. On Alpaca and Google-NQ, ODMA improves prediction accuracy of prior work significantly (e.g., from 82.68% to 93.36%). Serving DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on Cambricon MLU370-X4, ODMA raises memory utilization from 55.05% to 72.45% and improves RPS and TPS by 29% and 27% over static baselines. This demonstrates that hardware-aware allocation unlocks efficient LLM serving on RACM platforms.",2025-12-10 08:52:20+00:00,"['cs.AR', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09427v1
D$^2$GSLAM: 4D Dynamic Gaussian Splatting SLAM,"Recent advances in Dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in static environments. However, dense SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging. Most methods directly remove dynamic objects and focus solely on static scene reconstruction, which ignores the motion information contained in these dynamic objects. In this paper, we present D$^2$GSLAM, a novel dynamic SLAM system utilizing Gaussian representation, which simultaneously performs accurate dynamic reconstruction and robust tracking within dynamic environments. Our system is composed of four key components: (i) We propose a geometric-prompt dynamic separation method to distinguish between static and dynamic elements of the scene. This approach leverages the geometric consistency of Gaussian representation and scene geometry to obtain coarse dynamic regions. The regions then serve as prompts to guide the refinement of the coarse mask for achieving accurate motion mask. (ii) To facilitate accurate and efficient mapping of the dynamic scene, we introduce dynamic-static composite representation that integrates static 3D Gaussians with dynamic 4D Gaussians. This representation allows for modeling the transitions between static and dynamic states of objects in the scene for composite mapping and optimization. (iii) We employ a progressive pose refinement strategy that leverages both the multi-view consistency of static scene geometry and motion information from dynamic objects to achieve accurate camera tracking. (iv) We introduce a motion consistency loss, which leverages the temporal continuity in object motions for accurate dynamic modeling. Our D$^2$GSLAM demonstrates superior performance on dynamic scenes in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy, while also showing capability in accurate dynamic modeling.",2025-12-10 08:12:29+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09411v1
Generalizable Collaborative Search-and-Capture in Cluttered Environments via Path-Guided MAPPO and Directional Frontier Allocation,"Collaborative pursuit-evasion in cluttered environments presents significant challenges due to sparse rewards and constrained Fields of View (FOV). Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from inefficient exploration and fails to scale to large scenarios. We propose PGF-MAPPO (Path-Guided Frontier MAPPO), a hierarchical framework bridging topological planning with reactive control. To resolve local minima and sparse rewards, we integrate an A*-based potential field for dense reward shaping. Furthermore, we introduce Directional Frontier Allocation, combining Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) with geometric angle suppression to enforce spatial dispersion and accelerate coverage. The architecture employs a parameter-shared decentralized critic, maintaining O(1) model complexity suitable for robotic swarms. Experiments demonstrate that PGF-MAPPO achieves superior capture efficiency against faster evaders. Policies trained on 10x10 maps exhibit robust zero-shot generalization to unseen 20x20 environments, significantly outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines.",2025-12-10 08:09:12+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.LG', 'cs.MA']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09410v1
H2R-Grounder: A Paired-Data-Free Paradigm for Translating Human Interaction Videos into Physically Grounded Robot Videos,"Robots that learn manipulation skills from everyday human videos could acquire broad capabilities without tedious robot data collection. We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

Towards Resilient Transportation: A Conditional Transformer for Accident-Informed Traffic Forecasting,"Traffic prediction remains a key challenge in spatio-temporal data mining, despite progress in deep learning. Accurate forecasting is hindered by the complex influence of external factors such as traffic accidents and regulations, often overlooked by existing models due to limited data integration. To address these limitations, we present two enriched traffic datasets from Tokyo and California, incorporating traffic accident and regulation data. Leveraging these datasets, we propose ConFormer (Conditional Transformer), a novel framework that integrates graph propagation with guided normalization layer. This design dynamically adjusts spatial and temporal node relationships based on historical patterns, enhancing predictive accuracy. Our model surpasses the state-of-the-art STAEFormer in both predictive performance and efficiency, achieving lower computational costs and reduced parameter demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ConFormer consistently outperforms mainstream spatio-temporal baselines across multiple metrics, underscoring its potential to advance traffic prediction research.",2025-12-10 07:50:20+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09398v1
GAIR: GUI Automation via Information-Joint Reasoning and Group Reflection,"Building AI systems for GUI automation task has attracted remarkable research efforts, where MLLMs are leveraged for processing user requirements and give operations. However, GUI automation includes a wide range of tasks, from document processing to online shopping, from CAD to video editing. Diversity between particular tasks requires MLLMs for GUI automation to have heterogeneous capabilities and master multidimensional expertise, raising problems on constructing such a model. To address such challenge, we propose GAIR: GUI Automation via Information-Joint Reasoning and Group Reflection, a novel MLLM-based GUI automation agent framework designed for integrating knowledge and combining capabilities from heterogeneous models to build GUI automation agent systems with higher performance. Since different GUI-specific MLLMs are trained on different dataset and thus have different strengths, GAIR introduced a general-purpose MLLM for jointly processing the information from multiple GUI-specific models, further enhancing performance of the agent framework. The general-purpose MLLM also serves as decision maker, trying to execute a reasonable operation based on previously gathered information. When the general-purpose model thinks that there isn't sufficient information for a reasonable decision, GAIR would transit into group reflection status, where the general-purpose model would provide GUI-specific models with different instructions and hints based on their strengths and weaknesses, driving them to gather information with more significance and accuracy that can support deeper reasoning and decision. We evaluated the effectiveness and reliability of GAIR through extensive experiments on GUI benchmarks.",2025-12-10 07:40:23+00:00,"['cs.MA', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09396v1
CONCUR: A Framework for Continual Constrained and Unconstrained Routing,"AI tasks differ in complexity and are best addressed with different computation strategies (e.g., combinations of models and decoding methods). Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting.",2025-12-10 07:30:13+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09386v1
BugSweeper: Function-Level Detection of Smart Contract Vulnerabilities Using Graph Neural Networks,"The rapid growth of Ethereum has made it more important to quickly and accurately detect smart contract vulnerabilities. While machine-learning-based methods have shown some promise, many still rely on rule-based preprocessing designed by domain experts. Rule-based preprocessing methods often discard crucial context from the source code, potentially causing certain vulnerabilities to be overlooked and limiting adaptability to newly emerging threats. We introduce BugSweeper, an end-to-end deep learning framework that detects vulnerabilities directly from the source code without manual engineering. BugSweeper represents each Solidity function as a Function-Level Abstract Syntax Graph (FLAG), a novel graph that combines its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with enriched control-flow and data-flow semantics. Then, our two-stage Graph Neural Network (GNN) analyzes these graphs. The first-stage GNN filters noise from the syntax graphs, while the second-stage GNN conducts high-level reasoning to detect diverse vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on real-world contracts show that BugSweeper significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art detection methods. By removing the need for handcrafted rules, our approach offers a robust, automated, and scalable solution for securing smart contracts without any dependence on security experts.",2025-12-10 07:30:03+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09385v1
Observability Analysis and Composite Disturbance Filtering for a Bar Tethered to Dual UAVs Subject to Multi-source Disturbances,"Cooperative suspended aerial transportation is highly susceptible to multi-source disturbances such as aerodynamic effects and thrust uncertainties. To achieve precise load manipulation, existing methods often rely on extra sensors to measure cable directions or the payload's pose, which increases the system cost and complexity. A fundamental question remains: is the payload's pose observable under multi-source disturbances using only the drones' odometry information? To answer this question, this work focuses on the two-drone-bar system and proves that the whole system is observable when only two or fewer types of lumped disturbances exist by using the observability rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present such a conclusion and this result paves the way for more cost-effective and robust systems by minimizing their sensor suites. Next, to validate this analysis, we consider the situation where the disturbances are only exerted on the drones, and develop a composite disturbance filtering scheme. A disturbance observer-based error-state extended Kalman filter is designed for both state and disturbance estimation, which renders improved estimation performance for the whole system evolving on the manifold $(\mathbb{R}^3)^2\times(TS^2)^3$. Our simulation and experimental tests have validated that it is possible to fully estimate the state and disturbance of the system with only odometry information of the drones.",2025-12-10 07:17:04+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09377v1
Log NeRF: Comparing Spaces for Learning Radiance Fields,"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis, typically using sRGB images for supervision. However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage.",2025-12-10 07:12:33+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09375v1
Branching Strategies Based on Subgraph GNNs: A Study on Theoretical Promise versus Practical Reality,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for ``learning to branch'' in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). While standard Message-Passing GNNs (MPNNs) are efficient, they theoretically lack the expressive power to fully represent MILP structures. Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity.",2025-12-10 06:29:25+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'math.NA']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09355v1
COVLM-RL: Critical Object-Oriented Reasoning for Autonomous Driving Using VLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning,"End-to-end autonomous driving frameworks face persistent challenges in generalization, training efficiency, and interpretability. While recent methods leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through supervised learning on large-scale datasets to improve reasoning, they often lack robustness in novel scenarios. Conversely, reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches enhance adaptability but remain data-inefficient and lack transparent decision-making. % contribution To address these limitations, we propose COVLM-RL, a novel end-to-end driving framework that integrates Critical Object-oriented (CO) reasoning with VLM-guided RL. Specifically, we design a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy that enables the VLM to reason over critical traffic elements and generate high-level semantic decisions, effectively transforming multi-view visual inputs into structured semantic decision priors. These priors reduce the input dimensionality and inject task-relevant knowledge into the RL loop, accelerating training and improving policy interpretability. However, bridging high-level semantic guidance with continuous low-level control remains non-trivial. To this end, we introduce a consistency loss that encourages alignment between the VLM's semantic plans and the RL agent's control outputs, enhancing interpretability and training stability. Experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that COVLM-RL significantly improves the success rate by 30\% in trained driving environments and by 50\% in previously unseen environments, highlighting its strong generalization capability.",2025-12-10 06:18:16+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09349v1
Development and Testing for Perception Based Autonomous Landing of a Long-Range QuadPlane,"QuadPlanes combine the range efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft with the maneuverability of multi-rotor platforms for long-range autonomous missions. In GPS-denied or cluttered urban environments, perception-based landing is vital for reliable operation. Unlike structured landing zones, real-world sites are unstructured and highly variable, requiring strong generalization capabilities from the perception system. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges. Payload and volume constraints limit high-performance edge AI devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which are crucial for real-time detection and control. Accurate pose estimation during descent is necessary, especially in the absence of GPS, and relies on dependable visual-inertial odometry. Achieving this with limited edge AI resources requires careful optimization of the entire deployment framework. The flight characteristics of large QuadPlanes further complicate the problem. These aircraft exhibit high inertia, reduced thrust vectoring, and slow response times further complicate stable landing maneuvers. This work presents a lightweight QuadPlane system for efficient vision-based autonomous landing and visual-inertial odometry, specifically developed for long-range QuadPlane operations such as aerial monitoring. It describes the hardware platform, sensor configuration, and embedded computing architecture designed to meet demanding real-time, physical constraints. This establishes a foundation for deploying autonomous landing in dynamic, unstructured, GPS-denied environments.",2025-12-10 06:02:25+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.CV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09343v2
Visual Categorization Across Minds and Models: Cognitive Analysis of Human Labeling and Neuro-Symbolic Integration,"Understanding how humans and AI systems interpret ambiguous visual stimuli offers critical insight into the nature of perception, reasoning, and decision-making. This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations. Such architectures, informed by principles of embodiment, explainability, and cognitive alignment, offer a path toward AI systems that are not only performant but also interpretable and cognitively grounded.",2025-12-10 05:58:12+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09340v1
Efficiency-Aware Computational Intelligence for Resource-Constrained Manufacturing Toward Edge-Ready Deployment,"Industrial cyber physical systems operate under heterogeneous sensing, stochastic dynamics, and shifting process conditions, producing data that are often incomplete, unlabeled, imbalanced, and domain shifted. High-fidelity datasets remain costly, confidential, and slow to obtain, while edge devices face strict limits on latency, bandwidth, and energy. These factors restrict the practicality of centralized deep learning, hinder the development of reliable digital twins, and increase the risk of error escape in safety-critical applications. Motivated by these challenges, this dissertation develops an efficiency grounded computational framework that enables data lean, physics-aware, and deployment ready intelligence for modern manufacturing environments. The research advances methods that collectively address core bottlenecks across multimodal and multiscale industrial scenarios. Generative strategies mitigate data scarcity and imbalance, while semi-supervised learning integrates unlabeled information to reduce annotation and simulation demands. Physics-informed representation learning strengthens interpretability and improves condition monitoring under small-data regimes. Spatially aware graph-based surrogate modeling provides efficient approximation of complex processes, and an edge cloud collaborative compression scheme supports real-time signal analytics under resource constraints. The dissertation also extends visual understanding through zero-shot vision language reasoning augmented by domain specific retrieval, enabling generalizable assessment in previously unseen scenarios. Together, these developments establish a unified paradigm of data efficient and resource aware intelligence that bridges laboratory learning with industrial deployment, supporting reliable decision-making across diverse manufacturing systems.",2025-12-10 05:08:55+00:00,"['cs.CE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09319v1
Simultaneous Genetic Evolution of Neural Networks for Optimal SFC Embedding,"The reliance of organisations on computer networks is enabled by network programmability, which is typically achieved through Service Function Chaining. These chains virtualise network functions, link them, and programmatically embed them on networking infrastructure. Optimal embedding of Service Function Chains is an NP-hard problem, with three sub-problems, chain composition, virtual network function embedding, and link embedding, that have to be optimised simultaneously, rather than sequentially, for optimal results. Genetic Algorithms have been employed for this, but existing approaches either do not optimise all three sub-problems or do not optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We propose a Genetic Algorithm-based approach called GENESIS, which evolves three sine-function-activated Neural Networks, and funnels their output to a Gaussian distribution and an A* algorithm to optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We evaluate GENESIS on an emulator across 48 different data centre scenarios and compare its performance to two state-of-the-art Genetic Algorithms and one greedy algorithm. GENESIS produces an optimal solution for 100% of the scenarios, whereas the second-best method optimises only 71% of the scenarios. Moreover, GENESIS is the fastest among all Genetic Algorithms, averaging 15.84 minutes, compared to an average of 38.62 minutes for the second-best Genetic Algorithm.",2025-12-10 05:06:13+00:00,"['cs.NE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09318v1
Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function,"Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.",2025-12-10 05:05:10+00:00,"['physics.soc-ph', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'cs.AI', 'physics.comp-ph']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09317v2
Hetero-SplitEE: Split Learning of Neural Networks with Early Exits for Heterogeneous IoT Devices,"The continuous scaling of deep neural networks has fundamentally transformed machine learning, with larger models demonstrating improved performance across diverse tasks. This growth in model size has dramatically increased the computational resources required for the training process. Consequently, distributed approaches, such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, have become essential paradigms for scalable deployment. However, existing Split Learning approaches assume client homogeneity and uniform split points across all participants. This critically limits their applicability to real-world IoT systems where devices exhibit heterogeneity in computational resources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Hetero-SplitEE, a novel method that enables heterogeneous IoT devices to train a shared deep neural network in parallel collaboratively. By integrating heterogeneous early exits into hierarchical training, our approach allows each client to select distinct split points (cut layers) tailored to its computational capacity. In addition, we propose two cooperative training strategies, the Sequential strategy and the Averaging strategy, to facilitate this collaboration among clients with different split points. The Sequential strategy trains clients sequentially with a shared server model to reduce computational overhead. The Averaging strategy enables parallel client training with periodic cross-layer aggregation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets using ResNet-18 demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while efficiently supporting diverse computational constraints, enabling practical deployment of collaborative deep learning in heterogeneous IoT ecosystems.",2025-12-10 04:58:26+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09313v1
Scene-agnostic Hierarchical Bimanual Task Planning via Visual Affordance Reasoning,"Embodied agents operating in open environments must translate high-level instructions into grounded, executable behaviors, often requiring coordinated use of both hands. While recent foundation models offer strong semantic reasoning, existing robotic task planners remain predominantly unimanual and fail to address the spatial, geometric, and coordination challenges inherent to bimanual manipulation in scene-agnostic settings. We present a unified framework for scene-agnostic bimanual task planning that bridges high-level reasoning with 3D-grounded two-handed execution. Our approach integrates three key modules. Visual Point Grounding (VPG) analyzes a single scene image to detect relevant objects and generate world-aligned interaction points. Bimanual Subgoal Planner (BSP) reasons over spatial adjacency and cross-object accessibility to produce compact, motion-neutralized subgoals that exploit opportunities for coordinated two-handed actions. Interaction-Point-Driven Bimanual Prompting (IPBP) binds these subgoals to a structured skill library, instantiating synchronized unimanual or bimanual action sequences that satisfy hand-state and affordance constraints. Together, these modules enable agents to plan semantically meaningful, physically feasible, and parallelizable two-handed behaviors in cluttered, previously unseen scenes. Experiments show that it produces coherent, feasible, and compact two-handed plans, and generalizes to cluttered scenes without retraining, demonstrating robust scene-agnostic affordance reasoning for bimanual tasks.",2025-12-10 04:37:07+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09310v1
One-Shot Real-World Demonstration Synthesis for Scalable Bimanual Manipulation,"Learning dexterous bimanual manipulation policies critically depends on large-scale, high-quality demonstrations, yet current paradigms face inherent trade-offs: teleoperation provides physically grounded data but is prohibitively labor-intensive, while simulation-based synthesis scales efficiently but suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We present BiDemoSyn, a framework that synthesizes contact-rich, physically feasible bimanual demonstrations from a single real-world example. The key idea is to decompose tasks into invariant coordination blocks and variable, object-dependent adjustments, then adapt them through vision-guided alignment and lightweight trajectory optimization. This enables the generation of thousands of diverse and feasible demonstrations within several hour, without repeated teleoperation or reliance on imperfect simulation. Across six dual-arm tasks, we show that policies trained on BiDemoSyn data generalize robustly to novel object poses and shapes, significantly outperforming recent baselines. By bridging the gap between efficiency and real-world fidelity, BiDemoSyn provides a scalable path toward practical imitation learning for complex bimanual manipulation without compromising physical grounding.",2025-12-10 03:48:16+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09297v1
Identifying Bias in Machine-generated Text Detection,"The meteoric rise in text generation capability has been accompanied by parallel growth in interest in machine-generated text detection: the capability to identify whether a given text was generated using a model or written by a person. While detection models show strong performance, they have the capacity to cause significant negative impacts. We explore potential biases in English machine-generated text detection systems. We curate a dataset of student essays and assess 16 different detection systems for bias across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts. Finally, we perform human annotation and find that while humans perform generally poorly at the detection task, they show no significant biases on the studied attributes.",2025-12-10 03:34:12+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09292v1
UPETrack: Unidirectional Position Estimation for Tracking Occluded Deformable Linear Objects,"Real-time state tracking of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is critical for enabling robotic manipulation of DLOs in industrial assembly, medical procedures, and daily-life applications. However, the high-dimensional configuration space, nonlinear dynamics, and frequent partial occlusions present fundamental barriers to robust real-time DLO tracking. To address these limitations, this study introduces UPETrack, a geometry-driven framework based on Unidirectional Position Estimation (UPE), which facilitates tracking without the requirement for physical modeling, virtual simulation, or visual markers. The framework operates in two phases: (1) visible segment tracking is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and (2) occlusion region prediction employing UPE algorithm we proposed. UPE leverages the geometric continuity inherent in DLO shapes and their temporal evolution patterns to derive a closed-form positional estimator through three principal mechanisms: (i) local linear combination displacement term, (ii) proximal linear constraint term, and (iii) historical curvature term. This analytical formulation allows efficient and stable estimation of occluded nodes through explicit linear combinations of geometric components, eliminating the need for additional iterative optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that UPETrack surpasses two state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, including TrackDLO and CDCPD2, in both positioning accuracy and computational efficiency.",2025-12-10 03:14:12+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09283v1
FBA$^2$D: Frequency-based Black-box Attack for AI-generated Image Detection,"The prosperous development of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has brought people's anxiety about the spread of false information on social media. Designing detectors for filtering is an effective defense method, but most detectors will be compromised by adversarial samples. Currently, most studies exposing AIGC security issues assume information on model structure and data distribution. In real applications, attackers query and interfere with models that provide services in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs), which constitutes the black-box decision-based attack paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, decision-based attacks on AIGC detectors remain unexplored. In this study, we propose \textbf{FBA$^2$D}: a frequency-based black-box attack method for AIGC detection to fill the research gap. Motivated by frequency-domain discrepancies between generated and real images, we develop a decision-based attack that leverages the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for fine-grained spectral partitioning and selects frequency bands as query subspaces, improving both query efficiency and image quality. Moreover, attacks on AIGC detectors should mitigate initialization failures, preserve image quality, and operate under strict query budgets. To address these issues, we adopt an ``adversarial example soup'' method, averaging candidates from successive surrogate iterations and using the result as the initialization to accelerate the query-based attack. The empirical study on the Synthetic LSUN dataset and GenImage dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our prosed method. This study shows the urgency of addressing practical AIGC security problems.",2025-12-10 02:38:47+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09264v1
GLACIA: Instance-Aware Positional Reasoning for Glacial Lake Segmentation via Multimodal Large Language Model,"Glacial lake monitoring bears great significance in mitigating the anticipated risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods. However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\textbf{G}lacial \textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \textbf{C}ontextual \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66).

A Clinically Interpretable Deep CNN Framework for Early Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Using Grad-CAM-Based Explainable AI,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) constitutes a major global medical burden, marked by the gradual deterioration of renal function, which results in the impaired clearance of metabolic waste and disturbances in systemic fluid homeostasis. Owing to its substantial contribution to worldwide morbidity and mortality, the development of reliable and efficient diagnostic approaches is critically important to facilitate early detection and prompt clinical management. This study presents a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for early CKD detection from CT kidney images, complemented by class balancing using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and interpretability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The model was trained and evaluated on the CT KIDNEY DATASET, which contains 12,446 CT images, including 3,709 cyst, 5,077 normal, 1,377 stone, and 2,283 tumor cases.

CORE: A Conceptual Reasoning Layer for Large Language Models,"Large language models handle single-turn generation well, but multi-turn interactions still require the model to reconstruct user intent and task state from an expanding token history because internal representations do not persist across turns. This token-first paradigm leads to drift, inconsistent reasoning modes, and growing prompts as conversations deepen. We propose CORE, a concept-first interaction layer that improves multi-turn stability without modifying model weights. CORE combines a small library of universal cognitive operators with a persistent Local Concept - a compact semantic state capturing the task, constraints, preferences, and intermediate results. Each model call receives only this concept state, the user's latest instruction, and the selected operator, eliminating the need to replay full history. A preliminary prototype simulating CORE's behavior shows about 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this number reflects prototype conditions and should not be interpreted as a real-world performance estimate. CORE offers a model-agnostic mechanism that separates conceptual reasoning from language generation, suggesting a scalable direction for more stable multi-turn systems.",2025-12-10 01:08:06+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09222v1
MPC for momentum counter-balanced and zero-impulse contact with a free-spinning satellite,"In on-orbit robotics, a servicer satellite's ability to make contact with a free-spinning target satellite is essential to completing most on-orbit servicing (OOS) tasks. This manuscript develops a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that generates feasible controls for a servicer satellite to achieve zero-impulse contact with a free-spinning target satellite. The overall maneuver requires coordination between two separately actuated modules of the servicer satellite: (1) a moment generation module and (2) a manipulation module. We apply MPC to control both modules by explicitly modeling the cross-coupling dynamics between them. We demonstrate that the MPC controller can enforce actuation and state constraints that prior control approaches could not account for. We evaluate the performance of the MPC controller by simulating zero-impulse contact scenarios with a free-spinning target satellite via numerical Monte Carlo (MC) trials and comparing the simulation results with prior control approaches. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the MPC controller in maintaining spin synchronization and zero-impulse contact under operation constraints, moving contact location, and observation and actuation noise.",2025-12-10 00:53:10+00:00,"['eess.SY', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09213v1
Tensor-Compressed and Fully-Quantized Training of Neural PDE Solvers,"Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws into neural network training objectives. However, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is hindered by substantial computational and memory overhead, primarily stemming from higher-order automatic differentiation, intensive tensor operations, and reliance on full-precision arithmetic. To address these challenges, we present a framework that enables scalable and energy-efficient PINN training on edge devices. This framework integrates fully quantized training, Stein's estimator (SE)-based residual loss computation, and tensor-train (TT) decomposition for weight compression. It contributes three key innovations: (1) a mixed-precision training method that use a square-block MX (SMX) format to eliminate data duplication during backpropagation; (2) a difference-based quantization scheme for the Stein's estimator that mitigates underflow; and (3) a partial-reconstruction scheme (PRS) for TT-Layers that reduces quantization-error accumulation. We further design PINTA, a precision-scalable hardware accelerator, to fully exploit the performance of the framework. Experiments on the 2-D Poisson, 20-D Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB), and 100-D Heat equations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision, uncompressed baselines while delivering 5.5x to 83.5x speedups and 159.6x to 2324.1x energy savings.

LLMs for Analog Circuit Design Continuum (ACDC),"Large Language Models (LLMs) and transformer architectures have shown impressive reasoning and generation capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, their reliability and robustness in real-world engineering domains remain largely unexplored, limiting their practical utility in human-centric workflows. In this work, we investigate the applicability and consistency of LLMs for analog circuit design -- a task requiring domain-specific reasoning, adherence to physical constraints, and structured representations -- focusing on AI-assisted design where humans remain in the loop. We study how different data representations influence model behavior and compare smaller models (e.g., T5, GPT-2) with larger foundation models (e.g., Mistral-7B, GPT-oss-20B) under varying training conditions. Our results highlight key reliability challenges, including sensitivity to data format, instability in generated designs, and limited generalization to unseen circuit configurations. These findings provide early evidence on the limits and potential of LLMs as tools to enhance human capabilities in complex engineering tasks, offering insights into designing reliable, deployable foundation models for structured, real-world applications.",2025-12-09 23:57:28+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.PF']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09199v1
Towards Optimal Valve Prescription for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) Surgery: A Machine Learning Approach,"Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis, a life-threatening cardiovascular condition. Multiple transcatheter heart valves (THV) have been approved for use in TAVR, but current guidelines regarding valve type prescription remain an active topic of debate. We propose a data-driven clinical support tool to identify the optimal valve type with the objective of minimizing the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), a predominant postoperative complication. We synthesize a novel dataset that combines U.S. and Greek patient populations and integrates three distinct data sources (patient demographics, computed tomography scans, echocardiograms) while harmonizing differences in each country's record system. We introduce a leaf-level analysis to leverage population heterogeneity and avoid benchmarking against uncertain counterfactual risk estimates. The final prescriptive model shows a reduction in PPI rates of 26% and 16% compared with the current standard of care in our internal U.S. population and external Greek validation cohort, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first unified, personalized prescription strategy for THV selection in TAVR.",2025-12-09 23:46:46+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09198v1
Understanding Mental States in Active and Autonomous Driving with EEG,"Understanding how driver mental states differ between active and autonomous driving is critical for designing safe human-vehicle interfaces. This paper presents the first EEG-based comparison of cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal across the two driving modes. Using data from 31 participants performing identical tasks in both scenarios of three different complexity levels, we analyze temporal patterns, task-complexity effects, and channel-wise activation differences. Our findings show that although both modes evoke similar trends across complexity levels, the intensity of mental states and the underlying neural activation differ substantially, indicating a clear distribution shift between active and autonomous driving. Transfer-learning experiments confirm that models trained on active driving data generalize poorly to autonomous driving and vice versa. We attribute this distribution shift primarily to differences in motor engagement and attentional demands between the two driving modes, which lead to distinct spatial and temporal EEG activation patterns. Although autonomous driving results in lower overall cortical activation, participants continue to exhibit measurable fluctuations in cognitive load, fatigue, valence, and arousal associated with readiness to intervene, task-evoked emotional responses, and monotony-related passive fatigue. These results emphasize the need for scenario-specific data and models when developing next-generation driver monitoring systems for autonomous vehicles.",2025-12-09 23:30:52+00:00,"['cs.HC', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09190v1
WOLF: Werewolf-based Observations for LLM Deception and Falsehoods,"Deception is a fundamental challenge for multi-agent reasoning: effective systems must strategically conceal information while detecting misleading behavior in others. Yet most evaluations reduce deception to static classification, ignoring the interactive, adversarial, and longitudinal nature of real deceptive dynamics. Large language models (LLMs) can deceive convincingly but remain weak at detecting deception in peers. We present WOLF, a multi-agent social deduction benchmark based on Werewolf that enables separable measurement of deception production and detection. WOLF embeds role-grounded agents (Villager, Werewolf, Seer, Doctor) in a programmable LangGraph state machine with strict night-day cycles, debate turns, and majority voting. Every statement is a distinct analysis unit, with self-assessed honesty from speakers and peer-rated deceptiveness from others. Deception is categorized via a standardized taxonomy (omission, distortion, fabrication, misdirection), while suspicion scores are longitudinally smoothed to capture both immediate judgments and evolving trust dynamics. Structured logs preserve prompts, outputs, and state transitions for full reproducibility. Across 7,320 statements and 100 runs, Werewolves produce deceptive statements in 31% of turns, while peer detection achieves 71-73% precision with ~52% overall accuracy. Precision is higher for identifying Werewolves, though false positives occur against Villagers. Suspicion toward Werewolves rises from ~52% to over 60% across rounds, while suspicion toward Villagers and the Doctor stabilizes near 44-46%. This divergence shows that extended interaction improves recall against liars without compounding errors against truthful roles. WOLF moves deception evaluation beyond static datasets, offering a dynamic, controlled testbed for measuring deceptive and detective capacity in adversarial multi-agent interaction.",2025-12-09 23:14:20+00:00,"['cs.MA', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09187v1
Learning Patient-Specific Disease Dynamics with Latent Flow Matching for Longitudinal Imaging Generation,"Understanding disease progression is a central clinical challenge with direct implications for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $Δ$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $Δ$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.",2025-12-09 23:13:54+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09185v1
Prompt-Based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning,"We tackle continual adaptation of vision-language models to new attributes, objects, and their compositions in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), while preventing forgetting of prior knowledge. Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on UT-Zappos and C-GQA benchmarks demonstrate that PromptCCZSL achieves substantial improvements over prior VLM-based and non-VLM baselines, setting a new benchmark for CCZSL in closed-world settings.",2025-12-09 22:36:31+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09172v1

By combining the Matra-Genoa generative model, Orb-v2 universal machine learning interatomic potential, and ALIGNN graph neural network for energy prediction, we generated 119 million candidate structures and added 1.3 million DFT-validated compounds to the ALEXANDRIA database, including 74 thousand new stable materials. The expanded ALEXANDRIA database now contains 5.8 million structures with 175 thousand compounds on the convex hull. Predicted structural disorder rates (37-43%) match experimental databases, unlike other recent AI-generated datasets. Analysis reveals fundamental patterns in space group distributions, coordination environments, and phase stability networks, including sub-linear scaling of convex hull connectivity. We release the complete dataset, including sAlex25 with 14 million out-of-equilibrium structures containing forces and stresses for training universal force fields.

WonderZoom: Multi-Scale 3D World Generation,"We present WonderZoom, a novel approach to generating 3D scenes with contents across multiple spatial scales from a single image. Existing 3D world generation models remain limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a scale-aware 3D representation capable of generating and rendering content with largely different spatial sizes. WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to ""zoom into"" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features. Experiments demonstrate that WonderZoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video and 3D models in both quality and alignment, enabling multi-scale 3D world creation from a single image. We show video results and an interactive viewer of generated multi-scale 3D worlds in https://wonderzoom.github.io/",2025-12-09 22:21:07+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.GR']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09164v1
MindShift: Analyzing Language Models' Reactions to Psychological Prompts,"Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to absorb and reflect personality traits and attitudes specified by users. In our study, we investigated this potential using robust psychometric measures. We adapted the most studied test in psychological literature, namely Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and examined LLMs' behavior to identify traits. To asses the sensitivity of LLMs' prompts and psychological biases we created personality-oriented prompts, crafting a detailed set of personas that vary in trait intensity. This enables us to measure how well LLMs follow these roles. Our study introduces MindShift, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' psychological adaptability. The results highlight a consistent improvement in LLMs' role perception, attributed to advancements in training datasets and alignment techniques. Additionally, we observe significant differences in responses to psychometric assessments across different model types and families, suggesting variability in their ability to emulate human-like personality traits. MindShift prompts and code for LLM evaluation will be publicly available.",2025-12-09 21:56:54+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09149v1
Detecting Hallucinations in Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Attention Patterns and Semantic Alignment,"Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge from linearized subgraphs retrieved from knowledge graphs. However, LLMs struggle to interpret the relational and topological information in these inputs, resulting in hallucinations that are inconsistent with the retrieved knowledge. To analyze how LLMs attend to and retain structured knowledge during generation, we propose two lightweight interpretability metrics: Path Reliance Degree (PRD), which measures over-reliance on shortest-path triples, and Semantic Alignment Score (SAS), which assesses how well the model's internal representations align with the retrieved knowledge. Through empirical analysis on a knowledge-based QA task, we identify failure patterns associated with over-reliance on salient paths and weak semantic grounding, as indicated by high PRD and low SAS scores. We further develop a lightweight post-hoc hallucination detector, Graph Grounding and Alignment (GGA), which outperforms strong semantic and confidence-based baselines across AUC and F1. By grounding hallucination analysis in mechanistic interpretability, our work offers insights into how structural limitations in LLMs contribute to hallucinations, informing the design of more reliable GraphRAG systems in the future.",2025-12-09 21:52:50+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09148v1

"Integrated Pipeline for Coronary Angiography With Automated Lesion Profiling, Virtual Stenting, and 100-Vessel FFR Validation","Coronary angiography is the main tool for assessing coronary artery disease, but visual grading of stenosis is variable and only moderately related to ischaemia. Wire based fractional flow reserve (FFR) improves lesion selection but is not used systematically. Angiography derived indices such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) offer wire free physiology, yet many tools are workflow intensive and separate from automated anatomy analysis and virtual PCI planning. We developed AngioAI-QFR, an end to end angiography only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography derived QFR. The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045). The AUC for detecting FFR <= 0.80 was 0.93, with sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.86. The pipeline completed fully automatically in 93 percent of vessels, with median time to result 41 s. RFC profiling distinguished focal from diffuse capacity loss, and virtual stenting predicted larger QFR gain in focal than in diffuse disease. AngioAI-QFR provides a practical, near real time pipeline that unifies computer vision, functional profiling, and virtual PCI with automated angiography derived physiology.",2025-12-09 21:26:45+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09134v1
Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model for Automatic Pediatric Dental Record Understanding and Safe Antibiotic Recommendation,"Accurate interpretation of pediatric dental clinical records and safe antibiotic prescribing remain persistent challenges in dental informatics. Traditional rule-based clinical decision support systems struggle with unstructured dental narratives, incomplete radiographic descriptions, and complex safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model (KG-LLM) that integrates a pediatric dental knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-stage safety validation pipeline for evidence-grounded antibiotic recommendation. The framework first employs a clinical NER/RE module to extract structured entities and relations from dental notes and radiology reports. Relevant guidelines, drug-safety rules, and analogous historical cases are subsequently retrieved from the knowledge graph and supplied to the LLM for diagnostic summarization and dose-drug-duration prediction. Safety assurance is achieved through a dual-layer validation mechanism combining deterministic rule checking with a learned classifier for detecting allergies, contraindications, and dosing errors. Experiments on 32,000 de-identified pediatric dental visit records demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with a domain-adapted Llama-2 clinical baseline, KG-LLM improves record-understanding performance (F1: 0.914 vs. 0.867), drug-dose-duration accuracy (Top-1: 0.782 vs. 0.716), and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 50%. Additional evaluation across summary quality, recommendation accuracy, and global safety scores further confirms the robustness of the system. Ablation analyses indicate that the knowledge graph, RAG, and safety modules each contribute substantially to clinical reliability and interpretability.",2025-12-09 21:11:55+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09127v1

AI TIPS 2.0: A Comprehensive Framework for Operationalizing AI Governance,"The deployment of AI systems faces three critical governance challenges that current frameworks fail to adequately address. First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists. We present AI TIPS, Artificial Intelligence Trust-Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0, update to the comprehensive operational framework developed in 2019,four years before NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, that directly addresses these challenges.",2025-12-09 20:57:22+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09114v1
Semantic Trajectory Generation for Goal-Oriented Spacecraft Rendezvous,"Reliable real-time trajectory generation is essential for future autonomous spacecraft. While recent progress in nonconvex guidance and control is paving the way for onboard autonomous trajectory optimization, these methods still rely on extensive expert input (e.g., waypoints, constraints, mission timelines, etc.), which limits the operational scalability in real rendezvous missions. This paper introduces SAGES (Semantic Autonomous Guidance Engine for Space), a trajectory-generation framework that translates natural-language commands into spacecraft trajectories that reflect high-level intent while respecting nonconvex constraints. Experiments in two settings -- fault-tolerant proximity operations with continuous-time constraint enforcement and a free-flying robotic platform -- demonstrate that SAGES reliably produces trajectories aligned with human commands, achieving over 90% semantic-behavioral consistency across diverse behavior modes. Ultimately, this work marks an initial step toward language-conditioned, constraint-aware spacecraft trajectory generation, enabling operators to interactively guide both safety and behavior through intuitive natural-language commands with reduced expert burden.",2025-12-09 20:53:16+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI', 'math.OC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09111v2
Evolving Excellence: Automated Optimization of LLM-based Agents,"Agentic AI systems built on large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for automating complex workflows, from software development to customer support. However, LLM agents often underperform due to suboptimal configurations; poorly tuned prompts, tool descriptions, and parameters that typically require weeks of manual refinement. Existing optimization methods either are too complex for general use or treat components in isolation, missing critical interdependencies.
  We present ARTEMIS, a no-code evolutionary optimization platform that jointly optimizes agent configurations through semantically-aware genetic operators. Given only a benchmark script and natural language goals, ARTEMIS automatically discovers configurable components, extracts performance signals from execution logs, and evolves configurations without requiring architectural modifications.
  We evaluate ARTEMIS on four representative agent systems: the \emph{ALE Agent} for competitive programming on AtCoder Heuristic Contest, achieving a \textbf{$13.6\%$ improvement} in acceptance rate; the \emph{Mini-SWE Agent} for code optimization on SWE-Perf, with a statistically significant \textbf{10.1\% performance gain}; and the \emph{CrewAI Agent} for cost and mathematical reasoning on Math Odyssey, achieving a statistically significant \textbf{$36.9\%$ reduction} in the number of tokens required for evaluation. We also evaluate the \emph{MathTales-Teacher Agent} powered by a smaller open-source model (Qwen2.5-7B) on GSM8K primary-level mathematics problems, achieving a \textbf{22\% accuracy improvement} and demonstrating that ARTEMIS can optimize agents based on both commercial and local models.",2025-12-09 20:48:45+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09108v1
"Cognitive Trust in HRI: ""Pay Attention to Me and I'll Trust You Even if You are Wrong""","Cognitive trust and the belief that a robot is capable of accurately performing tasks, are recognized as central factors in fostering high-quality human-robot interactions. It is well established that performance factors such as the robot's competence and its reliability shape cognitive trust. Recent studies suggest that affective factors, such as robotic attentiveness, also play a role in building cognitive trust. This work explores the interplay between these two factors that shape cognitive trust. Specifically, we evaluated whether different combinations of robotic competence and attentiveness introduce a compensatory mechanism, where one factor compensates for the lack of the other. In the experiment, participants performed a search task with a robotic dog in a 2x2 experimental design that included two factors: competence (high or low) and attentiveness (high or low). The results revealed that high attentiveness can compensate for low competence. Participants who collaborated with a highly attentive robot that performed poorly reported trust levels comparable to those working with a highly competent robot. When the robot did not demonstrate attentiveness, low competence resulted in a substantial decrease in cognitive trust. The findings indicate that building cognitive trust in human-robot interaction may be more complex than previously believed, involving emotional processes that are typically overlooked. We highlight an affective compensatory mechanism that adds a layer to consider alongside traditional competence-based models of cognitive trust.",2025-12-09 20:41:29+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.HC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09105v1
Masked Generative Policy for Robotic Control,"We present Masked Generative Policy (MGP), a novel framework for visuomotor imitation learning. We represent actions as discrete tokens, and train a conditional masked transformer that generates tokens in parallel and then rapidly refines only low-confidence tokens. We further propose two new sampling paradigms: MGP-Short, which performs parallel masked generation with score-based refinement for Markovian tasks, and MGP-Long, which predicts full trajectories in a single pass and dynamically refines low-confidence action tokens based on new observations. With globally coherent prediction and robust adaptive execution capabilities, MGP-Long enables reliable control on complex and non-Markovian tasks that prior methods struggle with. Extensive evaluations on 150 robotic manipulation tasks spanning the Meta-World and LIBERO benchmarks show that MGP achieves both rapid inference and superior success rates compared to state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive policies. Specifically, MGP increases the average success rate by 9% across 150 tasks while cutting per-sequence inference time by up to 35x. It further improves the average success rate by 60% in dynamic and missing-observation environments, and solves two non-Markovian scenarios where other state-of-the-art methods fail.",2025-12-09 20:37:40+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09101v1
Characterizing Human Feedback-Based Control in Naturalistic Driving Interactions via Gaussian Process Regression with Linear Feedback,"Understanding driver interactions is critical to designing autonomous vehicles to interoperate safely with human-driven cars. We consider the impact of these interactions on the policies drivers employ when navigating unsigned intersections in a driving simulator. The simulator allows the collection of naturalistic decision-making and behavior data in a controlled environment. Using these data, we model the human driver responses as state-based feedback controllers learned via Gaussian Process regression methods. We compute the feedback gain of the controller using a weighted combination of linear and nonlinear priors. We then analyze how the individual gains are reflected in driver behavior. We also assess differences in these controllers across populations of drivers. Our work in data-driven analyses of how drivers determine their policies can facilitate future work in the design of socially responsive autonomy for vehicles.",2025-12-09 20:21:22+00:00,"['eess.SY', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09097v1
Calibrated Trust in Dealing with LLM Hallucinations: A Qualitative Study,"Hallucinations are outputs by Large Language Models (LLMs) that are factually incorrect yet appear plausible [1]. This paper investigates how such hallucinations influence users' trust in LLMs and users' interaction with LLMs. To explore this in everyday use, we conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants. Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Blöbaum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor. Based on these insights, we propose practical recommendations for responsible and reflective LLM use.",2025-12-09 19:59:23+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09088v1
Inferring Operator Emotions from a Motion-Controlled Robotic Arm,"A remote robot operator's affective state can significantly impact the resulting robot's motions leading to unexpected consequences, even when the user follows protocol and performs permitted tasks. The recognition of a user operator's affective states in remote robot control scenarios is, however, underexplored. Current emotion recognition methods rely on reading the user's vital signs or body language, but the devices and user participation these measures require would add limitations to remote robot control. We demonstrate that the functional movements of a remote-controlled robotic avatar, which was not designed for emotional expression, can be used to infer the emotional state of the human operator via a machine-learning system. Specifically, our system achieved 83.3$\%$ accuracy in recognizing the user's emotional state expressed by robot movements, as a result of their hand motions. We discuss the implications of this system on prominent current and future remote robot operation and affective robotic contexts.",2025-12-09 19:57:43+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.HC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09086v1
Mental Models of Autonomy and Sentience Shape Reactions to AI,"Narratives about artificial intelligence (AI) entangle autonomy, the capacity to self-govern, with sentience, the capacity to sense and feel. AI agents that perform tasks autonomously and companions that recognize and express emotions may activate mental models of autonomy and sentience, respectively, provoking distinct reactions. To examine this possibility, we conducted three pilot studies (N = 374) and four preregistered vignette experiments describing an AI as autonomous, sentient, both, or neither (N = 2,702). Activating a mental model of sentience increased general mind perception (cognition and emotion) and moral consideration more than autonomy, but autonomy increased perceived threat more than sentience. Sentience also increased perceived autonomy more than vice versa. Based on a within-paper meta-analysis, sentience changed reactions more than autonomy on average. By disentangling different mental models of AI, we can study human-AI interaction with more precision to better navigate the detailed design of anthropomorphized AI and prompting interfaces.",2025-12-09 19:56:52+00:00,"['cs.HC', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09085v1
Beyond the Hype: Comparing Lightweight and Deep Learning Models for Air Quality Forecasting,"Accurate forecasting of urban air pollution is essential for protecting public health and guiding mitigation policies. While Deep Learning (DL) and hybrid pipelines dominate recent research, their complexity and limited interpretability hinder operational use. This study investigates whether lightweight additive models -- Facebook Prophet (FBP) and NeuralProphet (NP) -- can deliver competitive forecasts for particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$) in Beijing, China. Using multi-year pollutant and meteorological data, we applied systematic feature selection (correlation, mutual information, mRMR), leakage-safe scaling, and chronological data splits. Both models were trained with pollutant and precursor regressors, with NP additionally leveraging lagged dependencies. For context, two machine learning baselines (LSTM, LightGBM) and one traditional statistical model (SARIMAX) were also implemented. Performance was evaluated on a 7-day holdout using MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. Results show that FBP consistently outperformed NP, SARIMAX, and the learning-based baselines, achieving test $R^2$ above 0.94 for both pollutants. These findings demonstrate that interpretable additive models remain competitive with both traditional and complex approaches, offering a practical balance of accuracy, transparency, and ease of deployment.",2025-12-09 19:39:45+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09076v1
Adaptive Thresholding for Visual Place Recognition using Negative Gaussian Mixture Statistics,"Visual place recognition (VPR) is an important component technology for camera-based mapping and navigation applications. This is a challenging problem because images of the same place may appear quite different for reasons including seasonal changes, weather illumination, structural changes to the environment, as well as transient pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Papers focusing on generating image descriptors for VPR report their results using metrics such as recall@K and ROC curves. However, for a robot implementation, determining which matches are sufficiently good is often reduced to a manually set threshold. And it is difficult to manually select a threshold that will work for a variety of visual scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of automatically selecting a threshold for VPR by looking at the 'negative' Gaussian mixture statistics for a place - image statistics indicating not this place. We show that this approach can be used to select thresholds that work well for a variety of image databases and image descriptors.",2025-12-09 19:34:43+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09071v1
KD-OCT: Efficient Knowledge Distillation for Clinical-Grade Retinal OCT Classification,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-related conditions are leading causes of vision loss worldwide, with optical coherence tomography (OCT) serving as a cornerstone for early detection and management. However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening.

ShelfAware: Real-Time Visual-Inertial Semantic Localization in Quasi-Static Environments with Low-Cost Sensors,"Many indoor workspaces are quasi-static: global layout is stable but local semantics change continually, producing repetitive geometry, dynamic clutter, and perceptual noise that defeat vision-based localization. We present ShelfAware, a semantic particle filter for robust global localization that treats scene semantics as statistical evidence over object categories rather than fixed landmarks. ShelfAware fuses a depth likelihood with a category-centric semantic similarity and uses a precomputed bank of semantic viewpoints to perform inverse semantic proposals inside MCL, yielding fast, targeted hypothesis generation on low-cost, vision-only hardware. Across 100 global-localization trials spanning four conditions (cart-mounted, wearable, dynamic obstacles, and sparse semantics) in a semantically dense, retail environment, ShelfAware achieves a 96% success rate (vs. 22% MCL and 10% AMCL) with a mean time-to-convergence of 1.91s, attains the lowest translational RMSE in all conditions, and maintains stable tracking in 80% of tested sequences, all while running in real time on a consumer laptop-class platform. By modeling semantics distributionally at the category level and leveraging inverse proposals, ShelfAware resolves geometric aliasing and semantic drift common to quasi-static domains. Because the method requires only vision sensors and VIO, it integrates as an infrastructure-free building block for mobile robots in warehouses, labs, and retail settings; as a representative application, it also supports the creation of assistive devices providing start-anytime, shared-control assistive navigation for people with visual impairments.",2025-12-09 19:33:19+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09065v1
Monitoring Deployed AI Systems in Health Care,"Post-deployment monitoring of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in health care is essential to ensure their safety, quality, and sustained benefit-and to support governance decisions about which systems to update, modify, or decommission. Motivated by these needs, we developed a framework for monitoring deployed AI systems grounded in the mandate to take specific actions when they fail to behave as intended. This framework, which is now actively used at Stanford Health Care, is organized around three complementary principles: system integrity, performance, and impact. System integrity monitoring focuses on maximizing system uptime, detecting runtime errors, and identifying when changes to the surrounding IT ecosystem have unintended effects. Performance monitoring focuses on maintaining accurate system behavior in the face of changing health care practices (and thus input data) over time. Impact monitoring assesses whether a deployed system continues to have value in the form of benefit to clinicians and patients. Drawing on examples of deployed AI systems at our academic medical center, we provide practical guidance for creating monitoring plans based on these principles that specify which metrics to measure, when those metrics should be reviewed, who is responsible for acting when metrics change, and what concrete follow-up actions should be taken-for both traditional and generative AI. We also discuss challenges to implementing this framework, including the effort and cost of monitoring for health systems with limited resources and the difficulty of incorporating data-driven monitoring practices into complex organizations where conflicting priorities and definitions of success often coexist. This framework offers a practical template and starting point for health systems seeking to ensure that AI deployments remain safe and effective over time.",2025-12-09 19:06:48+00:00,"['q-bio.OT', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09048v1
Astra: General Interactive World Model with Autoregressive Denoising,"Recent advances in diffusion transformers have empowered video generation models to generate high-quality video clips from texts or images. However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.",2025-12-09 18:59:57+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08931v1
"Same Content, Different Answers: Cross-Modal Inconsistency in MLLMs","We introduce two new benchmarks REST and REST+(Render-Equivalence Stress Tests) to enable systematic evaluation of cross-modal inconsistency in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs.",2025-12-09 18:57:07+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08923v1
OSMO: Open-Source Tactile Glove for Human-to-Robot Skill Transfer,"Human video demonstrations provide abundant training data for learning robot policies, but video alone cannot capture the rich contact signals critical for mastering manipulation. We introduce OSMO, an open-source wearable tactile glove designed for human-to-robot skill transfer. The glove features 12 three-axis tactile sensors across the fingertips and palm and is designed to be compatible with state-of-the-art hand-tracking methods for in-the-wild data collection. We demonstrate that a robot policy trained exclusively on human demonstrations collected with OSMO, without any real robot data, is capable of executing a challenging contact-rich manipulation task. By equipping both the human and the robot with the same glove, OSMO minimizes the visual and tactile embodiment gap, enabling the transfer of continuous shear and normal force feedback while avoiding the need for image inpainting or other vision-based force inference. On a real-world wiping task requiring sustained contact pressure, our tactile-aware policy achieves a 72% success rate, outperforming vision-only baselines by eliminating contact-related failure modes.

SAQ: Stabilizer-Aware Quantum Error Correction Decoder,"Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding faces a fundamental accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. Classical methods like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) exhibit variable performance across noise models and suffer from polynomial complexity, while tensor network decoders achieve high accuracy but at prohibitively high computational cost. Recent neural decoders reduce complexity but lack the accuracy needed to compete with computationally expensive classical methods. We introduce SAQ-Decoder, a unified framework combining transformer-based learning with constraint aware post-processing that achieves both near Maximum Likelihood (ML) accuracy and linear computational scalability with respect to the syndrome size. Our approach combines a dual-stream transformer architecture that processes syndromes and logical information with asymmetric attention patterns, and a novel differentiable logical loss that directly optimizes Logical Error Rates (LER) through smooth approximations over finite fields. SAQ-Decoder achieves near-optimal performance, with error thresholds of 10.99% (independent noise) and 18.6% (depolarizing noise) on toric codes that approach the ML bounds of 11.0% and 18.9% while outperforming existing neural and classical baselines in accuracy, complexity, and parameter efficiency. Our findings establish that learned decoders can simultaneously achieve competitive decoding accuracy and computational efficiency, addressing key requirements for practical fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.",2025-12-09 18:51:35+00:00,"['quant-ph', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08914v1
LiDAS: Lighting-driven Dynamic Active Sensing for Nighttime Perception,"Nighttime environments pose significant challenges for camera-based perception, as existing methods passively rely on the scene lighting. We introduce Lighting-driven Dynamic Active Sensing (LiDAS), a closed-loop active illumination system that combines off-the-shelf visual perception models with high-definition headlights. Rather than uniformly brightening the scene, LiDAS dynamically predicts an optimal illumination field that maximizes downstream perception performance, i.e., decreasing light on empty areas to reallocate it on object regions. LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control. Trained on synthetic data and deployed zero-shot in real-world closed-loop driving scenarios, LiDAS enables +18.7% mAP50 and +5.0% mIoU over standard low-beam at equal power. It maintains performances while reducing energy use by 40%. LiDAS complements domain-generalization methods, further strengthening robustness without retraining. By turning readily available headlights into active vision actuators, LiDAS offers a cost-effective solution to robust nighttime perception.",2025-12-09 18:47:56+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08912v1
Revisiting the Scaling Properties of Downstream Metrics in Large Language Model Training,"While scaling laws for Large Language Models (LLMs) traditionally focus on proxy metrics like pretraining loss, predicting downstream task performance has been considered unreliable. This paper challenges that view by proposing a direct framework to model the scaling of benchmark performance from the training budget. We find that for a fixed token-to-parameter ratio, a simple power law can accurately describe the scaling behavior of log accuracy on multiple popular downstream tasks. Our results show that the direct approach extrapolates better than the previously proposed two-stage procedure, which is prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, we introduce functional forms that predict accuracy across token-to-parameter ratios and account for inference compute under repeated sampling. We validate our findings on models with up to 17B parameters trained on up to 350B tokens across two dataset mixtures. To support reproducibility and encourage future research, we release the complete set of pretraining losses and downstream evaluation results.",2025-12-09 18:33:48+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08894v1
Toward Faithful Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Sparse Autoencoders,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by grounding outputs in retrieved evidence, but faithfulness failures, where generations contradict or extend beyond the provided sources, remain a critical challenge. Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens.",2025-12-09 18:33:22+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08892v1
"No Labels, No Problem: Training Visual Reasoners with Multimodal Verifiers","Visual reasoning is challenging, requiring both precise object grounding and understanding complex spatial relationships. Existing methods fall into two camps: language-only chain-of-thought approaches, which demand large-scale (image, query, answer) supervision, and program-synthesis approaches which use pre-trained models and avoid training, but suffer from flawed logic and erroneous grounding. We propose an annotation-free training framework that improves both reasoning and grounding. Our framework uses AI-powered verifiers: an LLM verifier refines LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, while a VLM verifier strengthens visual grounding through automated hard-negative mining, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. This design combines the strengths of modern AI systems: advanced language-only reasoning models for decomposing spatial queries into simpler subtasks, and strong vision specialist models improved via performant VLM critics. We evaluate our approach across diverse spatial reasoning tasks, and show that our method improves visual reasoning and surpasses open-source and proprietary models, while with our improved visual grounding model we further outperform recent text-only visual reasoning methods.

Accelerated Rotation-Invariant Convolution for UAV Image Segmentation,"Rotation invariance is essential for precise, object-level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery, where targets can have arbitrary orientations and exhibit fine-scale details. Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles.
  Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\(\times\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\(\times\)1024 inputs. Integrated into a U-Net segmentation model, the framework yields up to 6% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks.",2025-12-09 18:30:00+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08888v1
DAO-GP Drift Aware Online Non-Linear Regression Gaussian-Process,"Real-world datasets often exhibit temporal dynamics characterized by evolving data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm DAO-GP's robustness across stationary conditions, diverse drift types (abrupt, incremental, gradual), and varied data characteristics. Analyses demonstrate its dynamic adaptation, efficient in-memory and decay-based management, and evolving inducing points. Compared with state-of-the-art parametric and non-parametric models, DAO-GP consistently achieves superior or competitive performance, establishing it as a drift-resilient solution for online non-linear regression.",2025-12-09 18:12:38+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08879v1
"IPPO Learns the Game, Not the Team: A Study on Generalization in Heterogeneous Agent Teams","Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is commonly deployed in settings where agents are trained via self-play with homogeneous teammates, often using parameter sharing and a single policy architecture. This opens the question: to what extent do self-play PPO agents learn general coordination strategies grounded in the underlying game, compared to overfitting to their training partners' behaviors? This paper investigates the question using the Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Challenge (HeMAC) environment, which features distinct Observer and Drone agents with complementary capabilities. We introduce Rotating Policy Training (RPT), an approach that rotates heterogeneous teammate policies of different learning algorithms during training, to expose the agent to a broader range of partner strategies. When playing alongside a withheld teammate policy (DDQN), we find that RPT achieves similar performance to a standard self-play baseline, IPPO, where all agents were trained sharing a single PPO policy. This result indicates that in this heterogeneous multi-agent setting, the IPPO baseline generalizes to novel teammate algorithms despite not experiencing teammate diversity during training. This shows that a simple IPPO baseline may possess the level of generalization to novel teammates that a diverse training regimen was designed to achieve.",2025-12-09 18:10:17+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08877v1
When Tables Leak: Attacking String Memorization in LLM-Based Tabular Data Generation,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-quality tabular synthetic data. In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data.",2025-12-09 18:06:31+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08875v1
Siamese-Driven Optimization for Low-Resolution Image Latent Embedding in Image Captioning,"Image captioning is essential in many fields including assisting visually impaired individuals, improving content management systems, and enhancing human-computer interaction. However, a recent challenge in this domain is dealing with low-resolution image (LRI). While performance can be improved by using larger models like transformers for encoding, these models are typically heavyweight, demanding significant computational resources and memory, leading to challenges in retraining. To address this, the proposed SOLI (Siamese-Driven Optimization for Low-Resolution Image Latent Embedding in Image Captioning) approach presents a solution specifically designed for lightweight, low-resolution images captioning. It employs a Siamese network architecture to optimize latent embeddings, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the image-to-text translation process. By focusing on a dual-pathway neural network structure, SOLI minimizes computational overhead without sacrificing performance, making it an ideal choice for training on resource-constrained scenarios.",2025-12-09 18:05:59+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.HC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08873v1
Fed-SE: Federated Self-Evolution for Privacy-Constrained Multi-Environment LLM Agents,"LLM agents are widely deployed in complex interactive tasks, yet privacy constraints often preclude centralized optimization and co-evolution across dynamic environments. While Federated Learning (FL) has proven effective on static datasets, its extension to the open-ended self-evolution of agents remains underexplored. Directly applying standard FL is challenging: heterogeneous tasks and sparse, trajectory-level rewards introduce severe gradient conflicts, destabilizing the global optimization process. To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments.",2025-12-09 18:04:41+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08870v1
Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation Using Context-Aware GANs,"The widespread use of big data across sectors has raised major privacy concerns, especially when sensitive information is shared or analyzed. Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA impose strict controls on data handling, making it difficult to balance the need for insights with privacy requirements. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that reflect real patterns without exposing sensitive information. However, traditional synthetic data methods often fail to capture complex, implicit rules that link different elements of the data and are essential in domains like healthcare. They may reproduce explicit patterns but overlook domain-specific constraints that are not directly stated yet crucial for realism and utility. For example, prescription guidelines that restrict certain medications for specific conditions or prevent harmful drug interactions may not appear explicitly in the original data. Synthetic data generated without these implicit rules can lead to medically inappropriate or unrealistic profiles. To address this gap, we propose ContextGAN, a Context-Aware Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network that integrates domain-specific rules through a constraint matrix encoding both explicit and implicit knowledge. The constraint-aware discriminator evaluates synthetic data against these rules to ensure adherence to domain constraints, while differential privacy protects sensitive details from the original data. We validate ContextGAN across healthcare, security, and finance, showing that it produces high-quality synthetic data that respects domain rules and preserves privacy. Our results demonstrate that ContextGAN improves realism and utility by enforcing domain constraints, making it suitable for applications that require compliance with both explicit patterns and implicit rules under strict privacy guarantees.",2025-12-09 18:02:34+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CR']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08869v1
EcomBench: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Foundation Agents in E-commerce,"Foundation agents have rapidly advanced in their ability to reason and interact with real environments, making the evaluation of their core capabilities increasingly important. While many benchmarks have been developed to assess agent performance, most concentrate on academic settings or artificially designed scenarios while overlooking the challenges that arise in real applications. To address this issue, we focus on a highly practical real-world setting, the e-commerce domain, which involves a large volume of diverse user interactions, dynamic market conditions, and tasks directly tied to real decision-making processes. To this end, we introduce EcomBench, a holistic E-commerce Benchmark designed to evaluate agent performance in realistic e-commerce environments. EcomBench is built from genuine user demands embedded in leading global e-commerce ecosystems and is carefully curated and annotated through human experts to ensure clarity, accuracy, and domain relevance. It covers multiple task categories within e-commerce scenarios and defines three difficulty levels that evaluate agents on key capabilities such as deep information retrieval, multi-step reasoning, and cross-source knowledge integration.

We have a closer look at two prominent knowledge representation formalisms, description logics and logic programming, and discuss theoretical results and practical methods for computing interpolants.",2025-12-09 17:21:30+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08833v1
"InfiniteVL: Synergizing Linear and Sparse Attention for Highly-Efficient, Unlimited-Input Vision-Language Models","Window attention and linear attention represent two principal strategies for mitigating the quadratic complexity and ever-growing KV cache in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint. In streaming video understanding scenarios, it sustains a stable 24 FPS real-time prefill speed while preserving long-term memory cache.

CARLoS: Retrieval via Concise Assessment Representation of LoRAs at Scale,"The rapid proliferation of generative components, such as LoRAs, has created a vast but unstructured ecosystem. Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis.",2025-12-09 17:15:32+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08826v1
Training-Free Dual Hyperbolic Adapters for Better Cross-Modal Reasoning,"Recent research in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced our capabilities in cross-modal reasoning. However, existing methods suffer from performance degradation with domain changes or require substantial computational resources for fine-tuning in new domains. To address this issue, we develop a new adaptation method for large vision-language models, called \textit{Training-free Dual Hyperbolic Adapters} (T-DHA). We characterize the vision-language relationship between semantic concepts, which typically has a hierarchical tree structure, in the hyperbolic space instead of the traditional Euclidean space. Hyperbolic spaces exhibit exponential volume growth with radius, unlike the polynomial growth in Euclidean space. We find that this unique property is particularly effective for embedding hierarchical data structures using the Poincaré ball model, achieving significantly improved representation and discrimination power. Coupled with negative learning, it provides more accurate and robust classifications with fewer feature dimensions. Our extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the T-DHA method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image recognition and domain generalization tasks.",2025-12-09 17:12:22+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08820v1
Do Depth-Grown Models Overcome the Curse of Depth? An In-Depth Analysis,"Gradually growing the depth of Transformers during training can not only reduce training cost but also lead to improved reasoning performance, as shown by MIDAS (Saunshi et al., 2024). Thus far, however, a mechanistic understanding of these gains has been missing. In this work, we establish a connection to recent work showing that layers in the second half of non-grown, pre-layernorm Transformers contribute much less to the final output distribution than those in the first half - also known as the Curse of Depth (Sun et al., 2025, Csordás et al., 2025). Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks. In addition, we propose a lightweight modification of MIDAS that yields further improvements in downstream reasoning benchmarks. Overall, this work highlights how the gradual growth of model depth can lead to the formation of distinct computational circuits and overcome the limited depth utilization seen in standard non-grown models.",2025-12-09 17:12:04+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08819v1
Heterogeneity in Multi-Robot Environmental Monitoring for Resolving Time-Conflicting Tasks,"Multi-robot systems performing continuous tasks face a performance trade-off when interrupted by urgent, time-critical sub-tasks. We investigate this trade-off in a scenario where a team must balance area patrolling with locating an anomalous radio signal. To address this trade-off, we evaluate both behavioral heterogeneity through agent role specialization (""patrollers"" and ""searchers"") and sensing heterogeneity (i.e., only the searchers can sense the radio signal). Through simulation, we identify the Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying team compositions, with behaviorally heterogeneous teams demonstrating the most balanced trade-offs in the majority of cases. When sensing capability is restricted, heterogeneous teams with half of the sensing-capable agents perform comparably to homogeneous teams, providing cost-saving rationale for restricting sensor payload deployment. Our findings demonstrate that pre-deployment role and sensing specialization are powerful design considerations for multi-robot systems facing time-conflicting tasks, where varying the degree of behavioral heterogeneity can tune system performance toward either task.",2025-12-09 17:06:21+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08813v1
Emovectors: assessing emotional content in jazz improvisations for creativity evaluation,"Music improvisation is fascinating to study, being essentially a live demonstration of a creative process. In jazz, musicians often improvise across predefined chord progressions (leadsheets). How do we assess the creativity of jazz improvisations? And can we capture this in automated metrics for creativity for current LLM-based generative systems? Demonstration of emotional involvement is closely linked with creativity in improvisation. Analysing musical audio, can we detect emotional involvement? This study hypothesises that if an improvisation contains more evidence of emotion-laden content, it is more likely to be recognised as creative. An embeddings-based method is proposed for capturing the emotional content in musical improvisations, using a psychologically-grounded classification of musical characteristics associated with emotions. Resulting 'emovectors' are analysed to test the above hypothesis, comparing across multiple improvisations. Capturing emotional content in this quantifiable way can contribute towards new metrics for creativity evaluation that can be applied at scale.",2025-12-09 17:05:36+00:00,"['cs.SD', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08812v1
Multicalibration for LLM-based Code Generation,"As AI-based code generation becomes widespread, researchers are investigating the calibration of code LLMs - ensuring their confidence scores faithfully represent the true likelihood of code correctness. To do so, we investigate multicalibration, which can capture additional factors about a coding problem, such as complexity, code length, or programming language used. We study four multicalibration approaches on three function synthesis benchmarks, using latest-generation code LLMs (Qwen3 Coder, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our results demonstrate that multicalibration can yield distinct improvements over both uncalibrated token likelihoods (+1.03 in skill score) and baseline calibrations (+0.37 in skill score). We study the influence of the aforementioned factors in ablations, and make our dataset (consisting of code generations, likelihoods, and correctness labels) available for future research on code LLM calibration.",2025-12-09 17:04:01+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08810v1
PrivTune: Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Device-Cloud Collaboration,"With the rise of large language models, service providers offer language models as a service, enabling users to fine-tune customized models via uploaded private datasets. However, this raises concerns about sensitive data leakage. Prior methods, relying on differential privacy within device-cloud collaboration frameworks, struggle to balance privacy and utility, exposing users to inference attacks or degrading fine-tuning performance. To address this, we propose PrivTune, an efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning framework via Split Learning (SL). The key idea of PrivTune is to inject crafted noise into token representations from the SL bottom model, making each token resemble the $n$-hop indirect neighbors. PrivTune formulates this as an optimization problem to compute the optimal noise vector, aligning with defense-utility goals. On this basis, it then adjusts the parameters (i.e., mean) of the $d_χ$-Privacy noise distribution to align with the optimization direction and scales the noise according to token importance to minimize distortion. Experiments on five datasets (covering both classification and generation tasks) against three embedding inversion and three attribute inference attacks show that, using RoBERTa on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset, PrivTune reduces the attack success rate to 10% with only a 3.33% drop in utility performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.",2025-12-09 17:03:59+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08809v1
Democratizing ML for Enterprise Security: A Self-Sustained Attack Detection Framework,"Despite advancements in machine learning for security, rule-based detection remains prevalent in Security Operations Centers due to the resource intensiveness and skill gap associated with ML solutions. While traditional rule-based methods offer efficiency, their rigidity leads to high false positives or negatives and requires continuous manual maintenance. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid framework to democratize ML-based threat detection. The first stage employs intentionally loose YARA rules for coarse-grained filtering, optimized for high recall. The second stage utilizes an ML classifier to filter out false positives from the first stage's output. To overcome data scarcity, the system leverages Simula, a seedless synthetic data generation framework, enabling security analysts to create high-quality training datasets without extensive data science expertise or pre-labeled examples. A continuous feedback loop incorporates real-time investigation results to adaptively tune the ML model, preventing rule degradation.
  This proposed model with active learning has been rigorously tested for a prolonged time in a production environment spanning tens of thousands of systems. The system handles initial raw log volumes often reaching 250 billion events per day, significantly reducing them through filtering and ML inference to a handful of daily tickets for human investigation. Live experiments over an extended timeline demonstrate a general improvement in the model's precision over time due to the active learning feature. This approach offers a self-sustained, low-overhead, and low-maintenance solution, allowing security professionals to guide model learning as expert ``teachers''.",2025-12-09 16:58:08+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08802v1
ZK-APEX: Zero-Knowledge Approximate Personalized Unlearning with Executable Proofs,"Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model to satisfy privacy, copyright, and safety requirements. In real deployments, providers distribute a global model to many edge devices, where each client personalizes the model using private data. When a deletion request is issued, clients may ignore it or falsely claim compliance, and providers cannot check their parameters or data. This makes verification difficult, especially because personalized models must forget the targeted samples while preserving local utility, and verification must remain lightweight on edge devices.
  We introduce ZK APEX, a zero-shot personalized unlearning method that operates directly on the personalized model without retraining. ZK APEX combines sparse masking on the provider side with a small Group OBS compensation step on the client side, using a blockwise empirical Fisher matrix to create a curvature-aware update designed for low overhead. Paired with Halo2 zero-knowledge proofs, it enables the provider to verify that the correct unlearning transformation was applied without revealing any private data or personalized parameters.
  On Vision Transformer classification tasks, ZK APEX recovers nearly all personalization accuracy while effectively removing the targeted information. Applied to the OPT125M generative model trained on code data, it recovers around seventy percent of the original accuracy. Proof generation for the ViT case completes in about two hours, more than ten million times faster than retraining-based checks, with less than one gigabyte of memory use and proof sizes around four hundred megabytes. These results show the first practical framework for verifiable personalized unlearning on edge devices.",2025-12-09 16:52:26+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09953v1
Can TabPFN Compete with GNNs for Node Classification via Graph Tabularization?,"Foundation models pretrained on large data have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities across domains. Building on the success of TabPFN for tabular data and its recent extension to time series, we investigate whether graph node classification can be effectively reformulated as a tabular learning problem. We introduce TabPFN-GN, which transforms graph data into tabular features by extracting node attributes, structural properties, positional encodings, and optionally smoothed neighborhood features. This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs. These results demonstrate that principled feature engineering can bridge the gap between tabular and graph domains, providing a practical alternative to task-specific GNN training and LLM-dependent graph foundation models.",2025-12-09 16:51:30+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08798v1
MatteViT: High-Frequency-Aware Document Shadow Removal with Shadow Matte Guidance,"Document shadow removal is essential for enhancing the clarity of digitized documents. Preserving high-frequency details (e.g., text edges and lines) is critical in this process because shadows often obscure or distort fine structures. This paper proposes a matte vision transformer (MatteViT), a novel shadow removal framework that applies spatial and frequency-domain information to eliminate shadows while preserving fine-grained structural details. To effectively retain these details, we employ two preservation strategies. First, our method introduces a lightweight high-frequency amplification module (HFAM) that decomposes and adaptively amplifies high-frequency components. Second, we present a continuous luminance-based shadow matte, generated using a custom-built matte dataset and shadow matte generator, which provides precise spatial guidance from the earliest processing stage. These strategies enable the model to accurately identify fine-grained regions and restore them with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (RDD and Kligler) demonstrate that MatteViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a robust and practical solution for real-world document shadow removal. Furthermore, the proposed method better preserves text-level details in downstream tasks, such as optical character recognition, improving recognition performance over prior methods.",2025-12-09 16:40:10+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08789v1
A Systematic Evaluation of Preference Aggregation in Federated RLHF for Pluralistic Alignment of LLMs,"This paper addresses the challenge of aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse human preferences within federated learning (FL) environments, where standard methods often fail to adequately represent diverse viewpoints. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores. This work offers a robust methodology for evaluating LLM behavior across diverse populations and provides a practical solution for developing truly pluralistic and fairly aligned models.",2025-12-09 16:39:32+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08786v1
Fluent Alignment with Disfluent Judges: Post-training for Lower-resource Languages,"We propose a post-training method for lower-resource languages that preserves fluency of language models even when aligned by disfluent reward models. Preference-optimization is now a well-researched topic, but previous work has mostly addressed models for English and Chinese. Lower-resource languages lack both datasets written by native speakers and language models capable of generating fluent synthetic data. Thus, in this work, we focus on developing a fluent preference-aligned language model without any instruction-tuning data in the target language. Our approach uses an on-policy training method, which we compare with two common approaches: supervised finetuning on machine-translated data and multilingual finetuning. We conduct a case study on Norwegian Bokmål and evaluate fluency through native-speaker assessments. The results show that the on-policy aspect is crucial and outperforms the alternatives without relying on any hard-to-obtain data.",2025-12-09 16:31:48+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08777v1
Refining Visual Artifacts in Diffusion Models via Explainable AI-based Flaw Activation Maps,"Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis. However, addressing artifacts and unrealistic regions remains a critical challenge. We propose self-refining diffusion, a novel framework that enhances image generation quality by detecting these flaws. The framework employs an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based flaw highlighter to produce flaw activation maps (FAMs) that identify artifacts and unrealistic regions. These FAMs improve reconstruction quality by amplifying noise in flawed regions during the forward process and by focusing on these regions during the reverse process. The proposed approach achieves up to a 27.3% improvement in Fréchet inception distance across various diffusion-based models, demonstrating consistently strong performance on diverse datasets. It also shows robust effectiveness across different tasks, including image generation, text-to-image generation, and inpainting. These results demonstrate that explainable AI techniques can extend beyond interpretability to actively contribute to image refinement. The proposed framework offers a versatile and effective approach applicable to various diffusion models and tasks, significantly advancing the field of image synthesis.",2025-12-09 16:30:31+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08774v1
"A Practical Guide for Designing, Developing, and Deploying Production-Grade Agentic AI Workflows","Agentic AI marks a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks. Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.",2025-12-09 16:23:05+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08769v1
Data-Driven Dynamic Parameter Learning of manipulator robots,"Bridging the sim-to-real gap remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, as accurate dynamic parameter estimation is essential for reliable model-based control, realistic simulation, and safe deployment of manipulators. Traditional analytical approaches often fall short when faced with complex robot structures and interactions. Data-driven methods offer a promising alternative, yet conventional neural networks such as recurrent models struggle to capture long-range dependencies critical for accurate estimation. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based approach for dynamic parameter estimation, supported by an automated pipeline that generates diverse robot models and enriched trajectory data using Jacobian-derived features. The dataset consists of 8,192 robots with varied inertial and frictional properties. Leveraging attention mechanisms, our model effectively captures both temporal and spatial dependencies. Experimental results highlight the influence of sequence length, sampling rate, and architecture, with the best configuration (sequence length 64, 64 Hz, four layers, 32 heads) achieving a validation R2 of 0.8633. Mass and inertia are estimated with near-perfect accuracy, Coulomb friction with moderate-to-high accuracy, while viscous friction and distal link center-of-mass remain more challenging. These results demonstrate that combining Transformers with automated dataset generation and kinematic enrichment enables scalable, accurate dynamic parameter estimation, contributing to improved sim-to-real transfer in robotic systems",2025-12-09 16:15:58+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08767v1
Performance Comparison of Aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in 3D Wireless Environments,"Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) have emerged as key enablers for enhancing wireless coverage and capacity in next-generation networks. When mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they benefit from flexible deployment and improved line-of-sight conditions. Despite their promising potential, a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has not been thoroughly investigated. This letter presents a detailed performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in three-dimensional wireless environments. Accurate channel models incorporating directional radiation patterns are established, and the influence of deployment altitude and orientation is thoroughly examined. To optimize the system sum-rate, we formulate joint optimization problems for both architectures and propose an efficient solution based on the weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms. Simulation results reveal that STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, whereas RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes. The findings provide practical insights for the deployment of aerial intelligent surfaces in future 6G communication systems.",2025-12-09 16:06:09+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08755v1
A Multi-Robot Platform for Robotic Triage Combining Onboard Sensing and Foundation Models,"This report presents a heterogeneous robotic system designed for remote primary triage in mass-casualty incidents (MCIs). The system employs a coordinated air-ground team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to locate victims, assess their injuries, and prioritize medical assistance without risking the lives of first responders. The UAV identify and provide overhead views of casualties, while UGVs equipped with specialized sensors measure vital signs and detect and localize physical injuries. Unlike previous work that focused on exploration or limited medical evaluation, this system addresses the complete triage process: victim localization, vital sign measurement, injury severity classification, mental status assessment, and data consolidation for first responders. Developed as part of the DARPA Triage Challenge, this approach demonstrates how multi-robot systems can augment human capabilities in disaster response scenarios to maximize lives saved.",2025-12-09 16:05:22+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08754v1
Towards Foundation Models with Native Multi-Agent Intelligence,"Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly assuming the role of the ""brain"" of AI agents. While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.",2025-12-09 15:51:36+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.MA']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08743v2
Deconstructing the Dual Black Box:A Plug-and-Play Cognitive Framework for Human-AI Collaborative Enhancement and Its Implications for AI Governance,"Currently, there exists a fundamental divide between the ""cognitive black box"" (implicit intuition) of human experts and the ""computational black box"" (untrustworthy decision-making) of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper proposes a new paradigm of ""human-AI collaborative cognitive enhancement,"" aiming to transform the dual black boxes into a composable, auditable, and extensible ""functional white-box"" system through structured ""meta-interaction."" The core breakthrough lies in the ""plug-and-play cognitive framework""--a computable knowledge package that can be extracted from expert dialogues and loaded into the Recursive Adversarial Meta-Thinking Network (RAMTN). This enables expert thinking, such as medical diagnostic logic and teaching intuition, to be converted into reusable and scalable public assets, realizing a paradigm shift from ""AI as a tool"" to ""AI as a thinking partner."" This work not only provides the first engineering proof for ""cognitive equity"" but also opens up a new path for AI governance: constructing a verifiable and intervenable governance paradigm through ""transparency of interaction protocols"" rather than prying into the internal mechanisms of models. The framework is open-sourced to promote technology for good and cognitive inclusion. This paper is an independent exploratory research conducted by the author.

Mitigating Individual Skin Tone Bias in Skin Lesion Classification through Distribution-Aware Reweighting,"Skin color has historically been a focal point of discrimination, yet fairness research in machine learning for medical imaging often relies on coarse subgroup categories, overlooking individual-level variations. Such group-based approaches risk obscuring biases faced by outliers within subgroups. This study introduces a distribution-based framework for evaluating and mitigating individual fairness in skin lesion classification. We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS). These findings establish a robust methodology for advancing fairness at individual level in dermatological AI systems, and highlight broader implications for sensitive continuous attributes in medical image analysis.",2025-12-09 15:45:20+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08733v1
Towards Lossless Ultimate Vision Token Compression for VLMs,"Visual language models encounter challenges in computational efficiency and latency, primarily due to the substantial redundancy in the token representations of high-resolution images and videos. Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework. LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries. The experiments show that LUVC achieves a 2 speedup inference in language model with negligible accuracy degradation, and the training-free characteristic enables immediate deployment across multiple VLMs.",2025-12-09 15:40:13+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09010v1
Multi-domain performance analysis with scores tailored to user preferences,"The performance of algorithms, methods, and models tends to depend heavily on the distribution of cases on which they are applied, this distribution being specific to the applicative domain. After performing an evaluation in several domains, it is highly informative to compute a (weighted) mean performance and, as shown in this paper, to scrutinize what happens during this averaging. To achieve this goal, we adopt a probabilistic framework and consider a performance as a probability measure (e.g., a normalized confusion matrix for a classification task). It appears that the corresponding weighted mean is known to be the summarization, and that only some remarkable scores assign to the summarized performance a value equal to a weighted arithmetic mean of the values assigned to the domain-specific performances. These scores include the family of ranking scores, a continuum parameterized by user preferences, and that the weights to consider in the arithmetic mean depend on the user preferences. Based on this, we rigorously define four domains, named easiest, most difficult, preponderant, and bottleneck domains, as functions of user preferences. After establishing the theory in a general setting, regardless of the task, we develop new visual tools for two-class classification.",2025-12-09 15:29:53+00:00,"['cs.PF', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08715v1
Automatic Essay Scoring and Feedback Generation in Basque Language Learning,"This paper introduces the first publicly available dataset for Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) and feedback generation in Basque, targeting the CEFR C1 proficiency level. The dataset comprises 3,200 essays from HABE, each annotated by expert evaluators with criterion specific scores covering correctness, richness, coherence, cohesion, and task alignment enriched with detailed feedback and error examples. We fine-tune open-source models, including RoBERTa-EusCrawl and Latxa 8B/70B, for both scoring and explanation generation. Our experiments show that encoder models remain highly reliable for AES, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Latxa significantly enhances performance, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) closed-source systems such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scoring consistency and feedback quality. We also propose a novel evaluation methodology for assessing feedback generation, combining automatic consistency metrics with expert-based validation of extracted learner errors. Results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Latxa model produces criterion-aligned, pedagogically meaningful feedback and identifies a wider range of error types than proprietary models.

This structure allows the two agents to contribute different levels of effort towards enforcing safety requirements such as collision avoidance and inter-players spacing. We embed this non-normalized equilibrium into a receding-horizon optimal control scheme.",2025-12-09 15:08:02+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08688v1
Multi-Agent Intelligence for Multidisciplinary Decision-Making in Gastrointestinal Oncology,"Multimodal clinical reasoning in the field of gastrointestinal (GI) oncology necessitates the integrated interpretation of endoscopic imagery, radiological data, and biochemical markers. Despite the evident potential exhibited by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they frequently encounter challenges such as context dilution and hallucination when confronted with intricate, heterogeneous medical histories. In order to address these limitations, a hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework is proposed, which emulates the collaborative workflow of a human Multidisciplinary Team (MDT). The system attained a composite expert evaluation score of 4.60/5.00, thereby demonstrating a substantial improvement over the monolithic baseline. It is noteworthy that the agent-based architecture yielded the most substantial enhancements in reasoning logic and medical accuracy. The findings indicate that mimetic, agent-based collaboration provides a scalable, interpretable, and clinically robust paradigm for automated decision support in oncology.",2025-12-09 14:56:40+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.MA']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08674v1
Ergodic Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Sensor Footprints,"This paper addresses the problem of trajectory planning for information gathering with a dynamic and resolution-varying sensor footprint. Ergodic planning offers a principled framework that balances exploration (visiting all areas) and exploitation (focusing on high-information regions) by planning trajectories such that the time spent in a region is proportional to the amount of information in that region. Existing ergodic planning often oversimplifies the sensing model by assuming a point sensor or a footprint with constant shape and resolution. In practice, the sensor footprint can drastically change over time as the robot moves, such as aerial robots equipped with downward-facing cameras, whose field of view depends on the orientation and altitude. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new metric that accounts for dynamic sensor footprints, analyze the theoretic local optimality conditions, and propose numerical trajectory optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously optimize both the trajectories and sensor footprints, with up to an order of magnitude better ergodicity than conventional methods. We also deploy our approach in a multi-drone system to ergodically cover an object in 3D space.",2025-12-09 14:47:14+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08661v1

Sim2Swim: Zero-Shot Velocity Control for Agile AUV Maneuvering in 3 Minutes,"Holonomic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have the hardware ability for agile maneuvering in both translational and rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs). However, due to challenges inherent to underwater vehicles, such as complex hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, parametric uncertainties, and frequent changes in dynamics due to payload changes, control is challenging. Performance typically relies on carefully tuned controllers targeting unique platform configurations, and a need for re-tuning for deployment under varying payloads and hydrodynamic conditions. As a consequence, agile maneuvering with simultaneous tracking of time-varying references in both translational and rotational DOFs is rarely utilized in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first general zero-shot sim2real deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) velocity controller enabling path following and agile 6DOF maneuvering with a training duration of just 3 minutes. Sim2Swim, the proposed approach, inspired by state-of-the-art DRL-based position control, leverages domain randomization and massively parallelized training to converge to field-deployable control policies for AUVs of variable characteristics without post-processing or tuning.

A Sensor-Aware Phenomenological Framework for Lidar Degradation Simulation and SLAM Robustness Evaluation,"Lidar-based SLAM systems are highly sensitive to adverse conditions such as occlusion, noise, and field-of-view (FoV) degradation, yet existing robustness evaluation methods either lack physical grounding or do not capture sensor-specific behavior. This paper presents a sensor-aware, phenomenological framework for simulating interpretable lidar degradations directly on real point clouds, enabling controlled and reproducible SLAM stress testing. Unlike image-derived corruption benchmarks (e.g., SemanticKITTI-C) or simulation-only approaches (e.g., lidarsim), the proposed system preserves per-point geometry, intensity, and temporal structure while applying structured dropout, FoV reduction, Gaussian noise, occlusion masking, sparsification, and motion distortion. The framework features autonomous topic and sensor detection, modular configuration with four severity tiers (light--extreme), and real-time performance (less than 20 ms per frame) compatible with ROS workflows. Experimental validation across three lidar architectures and five state-of-the-art SLAM systems reveals distinct robustness patterns shaped by sensor design and environmental context.

"Aerial Vision-Language Navigation with a Unified Framework for Spatial, Temporal and Embodied Reasoning","Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments using onboard visual observation. This task holds promise for real-world applications such as low-altitude inspection, search-and-rescue, and autonomous aerial delivery. Existing methods often rely on panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry to support spatial reasoning and action planning. These requirements increase system cost and integration complexity, thus hindering practical deployment for lightweight UAVs. We present a unified aerial VLN framework that operates solely on egocentric monocular RGB observations and natural language instructions. The model formulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem, jointly optimizing spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction through prompt-guided multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose a keyframe selection strategy to reduce visual redundancy by retaining semantically informative frames, along with an action merging and label reweighting mechanism that mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalance and facilitates stable multi-task co-training. Extensive experiments on the Aerial VLN benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method. Under the challenging monocular RGB-only setting, our model achieves strong results across both seen and unseen environments.

We treat each task as a trajectory generation scenario defined by a specific number of drone-to-drone interactions. To model relationships across scenarios, we employ Multi-Task Gaussian Processes, which capture shared structure across tasks and enable efficient information transfer during optimization.

CogMCTS: A Novel Cognitive-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search Framework for Iterative Heuristic Evolution with Large Language Models,"Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) is an effective framework for solving complex optimization problems. The development of large language models (LLMs) enables the automated generation of heuristics. Existing LLM-based evolutionary methods rely on population strategies and are prone to local optima. Integrating LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improves the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, but multi-round cognitive integration remains limited and search diversity is constrained. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel cognitive-guided MCTS framework (CogMCTS). CogMCTS tightly integrates the cognitive guidance mechanism of LLMs with MCTS to achieve efficient automated heuristic optimization. The framework employs multi-round cognitive feedback to incorporate historical experience, node information, and negative outcomes, dynamically improving heuristic generation. Dual-track node expansion combined with elite heuristic management balances the exploration of diverse heuristics and the exploitation of high-quality experience. In addition, strategic mutation modifies the heuristic forms and parameters to further enhance the diversity of the solution and the overall optimization performance. The experimental results indicate that CogMCTS outperforms existing LLM-based AHD methods in stability, efficiency, and solution quality.",2025-12-09 13:54:18+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08609v2
Decoupled Design of Time-Varying Control Barrier Functions via Equivariances,"This article presents a systematic method for designing time-varying Control Barrier Functions (CBF) composed of a time-invariant component and multiple time-dependent components, leveraging structural properties of the system dynamics. The method involves the construction of a specific class of time-invariant CBFs that encode the system's dynamic capabilities with respect to a given constraint, and augments them subsequently with appropriately designed time-dependent transformations. While transformations uniformly varying the time-invariant CBF can be applied to arbitrary systems, transformations exploiting structural properties in the dynamics - equivariances in particular - enable the handling of a broader and more expressive class of time-varying constraints. The article shows how to leverage such properties in the design of time-varying CBFs. The proposed method decouples the design of time variations from the computationally expensive construction of the underlying CBFs, thereby providing a computationally attractive method to the design of time-varying CBFs. The method accounts for input constraints and under-actuation, and requires only qualitative knowledge on the time-variation of the constraints making it suitable to the application in uncertain environments.",2025-12-09 13:51:07+00:00,"['eess.SY', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08607v1
Decoupling Template Bias in CLIP: Harnessing Empty Prompts for Enhanced Few-Shot Learning,"The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model excels in few-shot learning by aligning visual and textual representations. Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias. This bias leads the model to rely on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness in classification. We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of ""emptiness"" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness.

Examining Student Interactions with a Pedagogical AI-Assistant for Essay Writing and their Impact on Students Writing Quality,"The dynamic nature of interactions between students and GenAI, as well as their relationship to writing quality, remains underexplored. While most research has examined how general-purpose GenAI can support writing, fewer studies have investigated how students interact with pedagogically designed systems across different phases of the writing process. To address this gap, we evaluated a GenAI-driven essay-writing assistant (EWA) designed to support higher education students in argumentative writing. Drawing on 1,282 interaction logs from 32 undergraduates during a two-hour writing session, Sequential Pattern Mining and K-Means clustering were used to identify behavioral patterns. Two clusters emerged: Cluster 1 emphasized outline planning and essay structure, while Cluster 2 focused on content development. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed a moderate effect size (r = 0.36) in the essay Organization dimension, with Cluster 1 showing higher scores. Qualitative analysis indicated that students with better performance actively wrote and shared essay sections with EWA for feedback, rather than interacted passively by asking questions. These findings suggest implications for teaching and system design. Teachers can encourage active engagement, while future EWAs may integrate automatic labeling and monitoring to prompt students to move from questioning to writing, enabling fuller benefits from GenAI-supported learning.",2025-12-09 13:34:33+00:00,"['cs.CY', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08596v1
The SMART+ Framework for AI Systems,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are now an integral part of multiple industries. In clinical research, AI supports automated adverse event detection in clinical trials, patient eligibility screening for protocol enrollment, and data quality validation. Beyond healthcare, AI is transforming finance through real-time fraud detection, automated loan risk assessment, and algorithmic decision-making. Similarly, in manufacturing, AI enables predictive maintenance to reduce equipment downtime, enhances quality control through computer-vision inspection, and optimizes production workflows using real-time operational data. While these technologies enhance operational efficiency, they introduce new challenges regarding safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. To address these concerns, we introduce the SMART+ Framework - a structured model built on the pillars of Safety, Monitoring, Accountability, Reliability, and Transparency, and further enhanced with Privacy & Security, Data Governance, Fairness & Bias, and Guardrails. SMART+ offers a practical, comprehensive approach to evaluating and governing AI systems across industries. This framework aligns with evolving mechanisms and regulatory guidance to integrate operational safeguards, oversight procedures, and strengthened privacy and governance controls. SMART+ demonstrates risk mitigation, trust-building, and compliance readiness. By enabling responsible AI adoption and ensuring auditability, SMART+ provides a robust foundation for effective AI governance in clinical research.",2025-12-09 13:33:14+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CY', 'cs.HC', 'eess.SY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08592v1
Mind to Hand: Purposeful Robotic Control via Embodied Reasoning,"Humans act with context and intention, with reasoning playing a central role. While internet-scale data has enabled broad reasoning capabilities in AI systems, grounding these abilities in physical action remains a major challenge. We introduce Lumo-1, a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) model that unifies robot reasoning (""mind"") with robot action (""hand""). Our approach builds upon the general multi-modal reasoning capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), progressively extending them to embodied reasoning and action prediction, and ultimately towards structured reasoning and reasoning-action alignment. This results in a three-stage pre-training pipeline: (1) Continued VLM pre-training on curated vision-language data to enhance embodied reasoning skills such as planning, spatial understanding, and trajectory prediction; (2) Co-training on cross-embodiment robot data alongside vision-language data; and (3) Action training with reasoning process on trajectories collected on Astribot S1, a bimanual mobile manipulator with human-like dexterity and agility. Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning to further refine reasoning-action consistency and close the loop between semantic inference and motor control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumo-1 achieves significant performance improvements in embodied vision-language reasoning, a critical component for generalist robotic control. Real-world evaluations further show that Lumo-1 surpasses strong baselines across a wide range of challenging robotic tasks, with strong generalization to novel objects and environments, excelling particularly in long-horizon tasks and responding to human-natural instructions that require reasoning over strategy, concepts and space.",2025-12-09 13:19:37+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08580v2
Disturbance-Free Surgical Video Generation from Multi-Camera Shadowless Lamps for Open Surgery,"Video recordings of open surgeries are greatly required for education and research purposes. However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing. Additionally, our approach showed improvements in video quality over existing techniques. Furthermore, we implemented several synthesis options for the proposed view-synthesis method and conducted a user study to assess surgeons' preferences for each option.",2025-12-09 13:15:32+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08577v1
RVC-NMPC: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Reciprocal Velocity Constraints for Mutual Collision Avoidance in Agile UAV Flight,"This paper presents an approach to mutual collision avoidance based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with time-dependent Reciprocal Velocity Constraints (RVCs). Unlike most existing methods, the proposed approach relies solely on observable information about other robots, eliminating the necessity of excessive communication use. The computationally efficient algorithm for computing RVCs, together with the direct integration of these constraints into NMPC problem formulation on a controller level, allows the whole pipeline to run at 100 Hz. This high processing rate, combined with modeled nonlinear dynamics of the controlled Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), is a key feature that facilitates the use of the proposed approach for an agile UAV flight. The proposed approach was evaluated through extensive simulations emulating real-world conditions in scenarios involving up to 10 UAVs and velocities of up to 25 m/s, and in real-world experiments with accelerations up to 30 m/s$^2$. Comparison with state of the art shows 31% improvement in terms of flight time reduction in challenging scenarios, while maintaining a collision-free navigation in all trials.",2025-12-09 13:13:27+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08574v1
A Hybrid Model for Stock Market Forecasting: Integrating News Sentiment and Time Series Data with Graph Neural Networks,"Stock market prediction is a long-standing challenge in finance, as accurate forecasts support informed investment decisions. Traditional models rely mainly on historical prices, but recent work shows that financial news can provide useful external signals. This paper investigates a multimodal approach that integrates companies' news articles with their historical stock data to improve prediction performance. We compare a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with a baseline LSTM model. Historical data for each company is encoded using an LSTM, while news titles are embedded with a language model. These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label. Experiments on the US equities and Bloomberg datasets show that the GNN outperforms the LSTM baseline, achieving 53% accuracy on the first target and a 4% precision gain on the second. Results also indicate that companies with more associated news yield higher prediction accuracy. Moreover, headlines contain stronger predictive signals than full articles, suggesting that concise news summaries play an important role in short-term market reactions.",2025-12-09 13:05:54+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08567v1
Bridging Scale Discrepancies in Robotic Control via Language-Based Action Representations,"Recent end-to-end robotic manipulation research increasingly adopts architectures inspired by large language models to enable robust manipulation. However, a critical challenge arises from severe distribution shifts between robotic action data, primarily due to substantial numerical variations in action commands across diverse robotic platforms and tasks, hindering the effective transfer of pretrained knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a semantically grounded linguistic representation to normalize actions for efficient pretraining. Unlike conventional discretized action representations that are sensitive to numerical scales, the motion representation specifically disregards numeric scale effects, emphasizing directionality instead. This abstraction mitigates distribution shifts, yielding a more generalizable pretraining representation. Moreover, using the motion representation narrows the feature distance between action tokens and standard vocabulary tokens, mitigating modality gaps. Multi-task experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves generalization performance and transferability in robotic manipulation tasks.",2025-12-09 12:45:12+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08548v1
Curriculum Guided Massive Multi Agent System Solving For Robust Long Horizon Tasks,"Large Language Models and multi-agent systems have shown promise in decomposing complex tasks, yet they struggle with long-horizon reasoning tasks and escalating computation cost. This work introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that distributes reasoning across a 64*64 grid of lightweight agents, supported by a selective oracle. A spatial curriculum progressively expands the operational region of the grid, ensuring that agents master easier central tasks before tackling harder peripheral ones. To improve reliability, the system integrates Negative Log-Likelihood as a measure of confidence, allowing the curriculum to prioritize regions where agents are both accurate and well calibrated. A Thompson Sampling curriculum manager adaptively chooses training zones based on competence and NLL-driven reward signals. We evaluate the approach on a spatially grounded Tower of Hanoi benchmark, which mirrors the long-horizon structure of many robotic manipulation and planning tasks. Results demonstrate improved stability, reduced oracle usage, and stronger long-range reasoning from distributed agent cooperation.",2025-12-09 12:40:39+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'cs.MA']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08545v1
A Novel Wasserstein Quaternion Generative Adversarial Network for Color Image Generation,"Color image generation has a wide range of applications, but the existing generation models ignore the correlation among color channels, which may lead to chromatic aberration problems. In addition, the data distribution problem of color images has not been systematically elaborated and explained, so that there is still the lack of the theory about measuring different color images datasets. In this paper, we define a new quaternion Wasserstein distance and develop its dual theory. To deal with the quaternion linear programming problem, we derive the strong duality form with helps of quaternion convex set separation theorem and quaternion Farkas lemma. With using quaternion Wasserstein distance, we propose a novel Wasserstein quaternion generative adversarial network. Experiments demonstrate that this novel model surpasses both the (quaternion) generative adversarial networks and the Wasserstein generative adversarial network in terms of generation efficiency and image quality.",2025-12-09 12:39:39+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'math.NA']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08542v1
vEDGAR -- Can CARLA Do HiL?,"Simulation offers advantages throughout the development process of automated driving functions, both in research and product development. Common open-source simulators like CARLA are extensively used in training, evaluation, and software-in-the-loop testing of new automated driving algorithms. However, the CARLA simulator lacks an evaluation where research and automated driving vehicles are simulated with their entire sensor and actuation stack in real time. The goal of this work is therefore to create a simulation framework for testing the automation software on its dedicated hardware and identifying its limits. Achieving this goal would greatly benefit the open-source development workflow of automated driving functions, designating CARLA as a consistent evaluation tool along the entire development process. To achieve this goal, in a first step, requirements are derived, and a simulation architecture is specified and implemented. Based on the formulated requirements, the proposed vEDGAR software is evaluated, resulting in a final conclusion on the applicability of CARLA for HiL testing of automated vehicles.

Principles2Plan: LLM-Guided System for Operationalising Ethical Principles into Plans,"Ethical awareness is critical for robots operating in human environments, yet existing automated planning tools provide little support. Manually specifying ethical rules is labour-intensive and highly context-specific. We present Principles2Plan, an interactive research prototype demonstrating how a human and a Large Language Model (LLM) can collaborate to produce context-sensitive ethical rules and guide automated planning. A domain expert provides the planning domain, problem details, and relevant high-level principles such as beneficence and privacy. The system generates operationalisable ethical rules consistent with these principles, which the user can review, prioritise, and supply to a planner to produce ethically-informed plans. To our knowledge, no prior system supports users in generating principle-grounded rules for classical planning contexts. Principles2Plan showcases the potential of human-LLM collaboration for making ethical automated planning more practical and feasible.",2025-12-09 12:34:54+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08536v1
Llama-based source code vulnerability detection: Prompt engineering vs Fine tuning,"The significant increase in software production, driven by the acceleration of development cycles over the past two decades, has led to a steady rise in software vulnerabilities, as shown by statistics published yearly by the CVE program. The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods. Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task. The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task. We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach. We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets. Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD. Though prompting proved ineffective, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) performed relatively well as an example selection technique. Overall, some of our research questions have been answered, and many are still on hold, which leaves us many future work perspectives.

SensHRPS: Sensing Comfortable Human-Robot Proxemics and Personal Space With Eye-Tracking,"Social robots must adjust to human proxemic norms to ensure user comfort and engagement. While prior research demonstrates that eye-tracking features reliably estimate comfort in human-human interactions, their applicability to interactions with humanoid robots remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate user comfort with the robot ""Ameca"" across four experimentally controlled distances (0.5 m to 2.0 m) using mobile eye-tracking and subjective reporting (N=19). We evaluate multiple machine learning and deep learning models to estimate comfort based on gaze features. Contrary to previous human-human studies where Transformer models excelled, a Decision Tree classifier achieved the highest performance (F1-score = 0.73), with minimum pupil diameter identified as the most critical predictor. These findings suggest that physiological comfort thresholds in human-robot interaction differ from human-human dynamics and can be effectively modeled using interpretable logic.",2025-12-09 12:08:21+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI', 'cs.HC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08518v2
A Lightweight Transfer Learning-Based State-of-Health Monitoring with Application to Lithium-ion Batteries in Unmanned Air Vehicles,"Accurate and rapid state-of-health (SOH) monitoring plays an important role in indicating energy information for lithium-ion battery-powered portable mobile devices. To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error.",2025-12-09 11:54:09+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08512v1
Disrupting Hierarchical Reasoning: Adversarial Protection for Geographic Privacy in Multimodal Reasoning Models,"Multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) pose significant privacy risks by inferring precise geographic locations from personal images through hierarchical chain-of-thought reasoning. Existing privacy protection techniques, primarily designed for perception-based models, prove ineffective against MLRMs' sophisticated multi-step reasoning processes that analyze environmental cues. We introduce \textbf{ReasonBreak}, a novel adversarial framework specifically designed to disrupt hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through concept-aware perturbations. Our approach is founded on the key insight that effective disruption of geographic reasoning requires perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies rather than uniform noise. ReasonBreak strategically targets critical conceptual dependencies within reasoning chains, generating perturbations that invalidate specific inference steps and cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. To facilitate this approach, we contribute \textbf{GeoPrivacy-6K}, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images ($\geq$2K) with hierarchical concept annotations. Extensive evaluation across seven state-of-the-art MLRMs (including GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrates ReasonBreak's superior effectiveness, achieving a 14.4\% improvement in tract-level protection (33.8\% vs 19.4\%) and nearly doubling block-level protection (33.5\% vs 16.8\%). This work establishes a new paradigm for privacy protection against reasoning-based threats.",2025-12-09 11:35:51+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08503v1
Developing Distance-Aware Uncertainty Quantification Methods in Physics-Guided Neural Networks for Reliable Bearing Health Prediction,"Accurate and uncertainty-aware degradation estimation is essential for predictive maintenance in safety-critical systems like rotating machinery with rolling-element bearings. Many existing uncertainty methods lack confidence calibration, are costly to run, are not distance-aware, and fail to generalize under out-of-distribution data. We introduce two distance-aware uncertainty methods for deterministic physics-guided neural networks: PG-SNGP, based on Spectral Normalization Gaussian Process, and PG-SNER, based on Deep Evidential Regression. We apply spectral normalization to the hidden layers so the network preserves distances from input to latent space. PG-SNGP replaces the final dense layer with a Gaussian Process layer for distance-sensitive uncertainty, while PG-SNER outputs Normal Inverse Gamma parameters to model uncertainty in a coherent probabilistic form. We assess performance using standard accuracy metrics and a new distance-aware metric based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which measures how well predicted uncertainty tracks the distance between test and training samples. We also design a dynamic weighting scheme in the loss to balance data fidelity and physical consistency. We test our methods on rolling-element bearing degradation using the PRONOSTIA dataset and compare them with Monte Carlo and Deep Ensemble PGNNs. Results show that PG-SNGP and PG-SNER improve prediction accuracy, generalize reliably under OOD conditions, and remain robust to adversarial attacks and noise.",2025-12-09 11:30:41+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08499v1
LLM-based Vulnerable Code Augmentation: Generate or Refactor?,"Vulnerability code-bases often suffer from severe imbalance, limiting the effectiveness of Deep Learning-based vulnerability classifiers. Data Augmentation could help solve this by mitigating the scarcity of under-represented CWEs. In this context, we investigate LLM-based augmentation for vulnerable functions, comparing controlled generation of new vulnerable samples with semantics-preserving refactoring of existing ones. Using Qwen2.5-Coder to produce augmented data and CodeBERT as a vulnerability classifier on the SVEN dataset, we find that our approaches are indeed effective in enriching vulnerable code-bases through a simple process and with reasonable quality, and that a hybrid strategy best boosts vulnerability classifiers' performance.",2025-12-09 11:15:13+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08493v1
Autonomous Issue Resolver: Towards Zero-Touch Code Maintenance,"Recent advances in Large Language Models have revolutionized function-level code generation; however, repository-scale Automated Program Repair (APR) remains a significant challenge. Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the standard Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to the concept of Data Transformation Graph (DTG) that inverts the topology by modeling data states as nodes and functions as edges, enabling agents to trace logic defects through data lineage rather than control flow. We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the ""Semantic Trap"" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark. Our approach directly addresses the core limitations of current AI code-assistant tools and tackles the critical need for a more robust foundation for our increasingly software-dependent world.",2025-12-09 11:11:37+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08492v1
Prospect Theory in Physical Human-Robot Interaction: A Pilot Study of Probability Perception,"Understanding how humans respond to uncertainty is critical for designing safe and effective physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), as physically working with robots introduces multiple sources of uncertainty, including trust, comfort, and perceived safety. Conventional pHRI control frameworks typically build on optimal control theory, which assumes that human actions minimize a cost function; however, human behavior under uncertainty often departs from such optimal patterns. To address this gap, additional understanding of human behavior under uncertainty is needed. This pilot study implemented a physically coupled target-reaching task in which the robot delivered assistance or disturbances with systematically varied probabilities (10\% to 90\%). Analysis of participants' force inputs and decision-making strategies revealed two distinct behavioral clusters: a ""trade-off"" group that modulated their physical responses according to disturbance likelihood, and an ""always-compensate"" group characterized by strong risk aversion irrespective of probability. These findings provide empirical evidence that human decision-making in pHRI is highly individualized and that the perception of probability can differ to its true value. Accordingly, the study highlights the need for more interpretable behavioral models, such as cumulative prospect theory (CPT), to more accurately capture these behaviors and inform the design of future adaptive robot controllers.",2025-12-09 10:55:58+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08481v1
Visionary: The World Model Carrier Built on WebGPU-Powered Gaussian Splatting Platform,"Neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has evolved rapidly and become a key component for building world models. However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, ""click-to-run"" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.",2025-12-09 10:54:58+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.GR']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08478v1
ContextDrag: Precise Drag-Based Image Editing via Context-Preserving Token Injection and Position-Consistent Attention,"Drag-based image editing aims to modify visual content followed by user-specified drag operations. Despite existing methods having made notable progress, they still fail to fully exploit the contextual information in the reference image, including fine-grained texture details, leading to edits with limited coherence and fidelity. To address this challenge, we introduce ContextDrag, a new paradigm for drag-based editing that leverages the strong contextual modeling capability of editing models, such as FLUX-Kontext. By incorporating VAE-encoded features from the reference image, ContextDrag can leverage rich contextual cues and preserve fine-grained details, without the need for finetuning or inversion. Specifically, ContextDrag introduced a novel Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features into their correct destination locations via a Latent-space Reverse Mapping (LRM) algorithm. This strategy enables precise drag control while preserving consistency in both semantics and texture details. Second, ContextDrag adopts a novel Position-Consistent Attention (PCA), which positional re-encodes the reference tokens and applies overlap-aware masking to eliminate interference from irrelevant reference features. Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that our approach surpasses all existing SOTA methods.

A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Design Space Exploration in Autonomous Driving Systems,"Designing autonomous driving systems requires efficient exploration of large hardware/software configuration spaces under diverse environmental conditions, e.g., with varying traffic, weather, and road layouts. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) approaches struggle with multi-modal execution outputs and complex performance trade-offs, and often require human involvement to assess correctness based on execution outputs. This paper presents a multi-agent, large language model (LLM)-based DSE framework, which integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools to automate the interpretation of execution outputs and guide the exploration of system designs. Specialized LLM agents are leveraged to handle user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of both visual and textual execution outputs, which enables identification of potential bottlenecks without human intervention. A prototype implementation is developed and evaluated on a robotaxi case study (an SAE Level 4 autonomous driving application). Compared with a genetic algorithm baseline, the proposed framework identifies more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under the same exploration budget. Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the adoption of the LLM-based approach for DSE. We believe that this framework paves the way to the design automation of autonomous driving systems.",2025-12-09 10:50:19+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08476v1
Using reinforcement learning to probe the role of feedback in skill acquisition,"Many high-performance human activities are executed with little or no external feedback: think of a figure skater landing a triple jump, a pitcher throwing a curveball for a strike, or a barista pouring latte art. To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.",2025-12-09 10:37:42+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.RO', 'eess.SY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08463v1

Biothreat Benchmark Generation Framework for Evaluating Frontier AI Models II: Benchmark Generation Process,"The potential for rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons has generated significant policy, academic, and public concern. Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate any risk, with an important element of such efforts being the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper, the second in a series of three, describes the second component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) framework: the generation of the Bacterial Biothreat Benchmark (B3) dataset.

A process of de-duplication, followed by an assessment of uplift diagnosticity, and general quality control measures, reduced the candidates to a set of 1,010 final benchmarks. This procedure ensured that these benchmarks are a) diagnostic in terms of providing uplift; b) directly relevant to biosecurity threats; and c) are aligned with a larger biosecurity architecture permitting nuanced analysis at different levels of analysis.",2025-12-09 10:24:25+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CY', 'cs.ET']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08451v1
From Accuracy to Impact: The Impact-Driven AI Framework (IDAIF) for Aligning Engineering Architecture with Theory of Change,"This paper introduces the Impact-Driven AI Framework (IDAIF), a novel architectural methodology that integrates Theory of Change (ToC) principles with modern artificial intelligence system design. As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures. Three case studies demonstrate IDAIF application across healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering domains. This framework represents a paradigm shift from model-centric to impact-centric AI development, providing engineers with concrete architectural patterns for building ethical, trustworthy, and socially beneficial AI systems.",2025-12-09 10:21:02+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08449v1
SDT-6D: Fully Sparse Depth-Transformer for Staged End-to-End 6D Pose Estimation in Industrial Multi-View Bin Picking,"Accurately recovering 6D poses in densely packed industrial bin-picking environments remain a serious challenge, owing to occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts. We introduce a holistic depth-only 6D pose estimation approach that fuses multi-view depth maps into either a fine-grained 3D point cloud in its vanilla version, or a sparse Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). At the core of our framework lies a staged heatmap mechanism that yields scene-adaptive attention priors across different resolutions, steering computation toward foreground regions, thus keeping memory requirements at high resolutions feasible. Along, we propose a density-aware sparse transformer block that dynamically attends to (self-) occlusions and the non-uniform distribution of 3D data. While sparse 3D approaches has proven effective for long-range perception, its potential in close-range robotic applications remains underexplored. Our framework operates fully sparse, enabling high-resolution volumetric representations to capture fine geometric details crucial for accurate pose estimation in clutter. Our method processes the entire scene integrally, predicting the 6D pose via a novel per-voxel voting strategy, allowing simultaneous pose predictions for an arbitrary number of target objects. We validate our method on the recently published IPD and MV-YCB multi-view datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in heavily cluttered industrial and household bin picking scenarios.",2025-12-09 09:58:35+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08430v1
Prismatic World Model: Learning Compositional Dynamics for Planning in Hybrid Systems,"Model-based planning in robotic domains is fundamentally challenged by the hybrid nature of physical dynamics, where continuous motion is punctuated by discrete events such as contacts and impacts. Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents.",2025-12-09 09:40:34+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08411v1
Learning Robot Manipulation from Audio World Models,"World models have demonstrated impressive performance on robotic learning tasks. Many such tasks inherently demand multimodal reasoning; for example, filling a bottle with water will lead to visual information alone being ambiguous or incomplete, thereby requiring reasoning over the temporal evolution of audio, accounting for its underlying physical properties and pitch patterns. In this paper, we propose a generative latent flow matching model to anticipate future audio observations, enabling the system to reason about long-term consequences when integrated into a robot policy. We demonstrate the superior capabilities of our system through two manipulation tasks that require perceiving in-the-wild audio or music signals, compared to methods without future lookahead. We further emphasize that successful robot action learning for these tasks relies not merely on multi-modal input, but critically on the accurate prediction of future audio states that embody intrinsic rhythmic patterns.",2025-12-09 09:36:51+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08405v1
Are generative AI text annotations systematically biased?,"This paper investigates bias in GLLM annotations by conceptually replicating manual annotations of Boukes (2024). Using various GLLMs (Llama3.1:8b, Llama3.3:70b, GPT4o, Qwen2.5:72b) in combination with five different prompts for five concepts (political content, interactivity, rationality, incivility, and ideology). We find GLLMs perform adequate in terms of F1 scores, but differ from manual annotations in terms of prevalence, yield substantively different downstream results, and display systematic bias in that they overlap more with each other than with manual annotations. Differences in F1 scores fail to account for the degree of bias.",2025-12-09 09:36:43+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08404v1
DeepFeature: Iterative Context-aware Feature Generation for Wearable Biosignals,"Biosignals collected from wearable devices are widely utilized in healthcare applications. Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing. Experimental evaluation results show that DeepFeature achieves an average AUROC improvement of 4.21-9.67% across eight diverse tasks compared to baseline methods. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on five tasks while maintaining comparable performance on the remaining tasks.",2025-12-09 09:06:17+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08379v1
Reflecting with Two Voices: A Co-Adaptive Dual-Strategy Framework for LLM-Based Agent Decision Making,"Large language model (LLM) agents often rely on external demonstrations or retrieval-augmented planning, leading to brittleness, poor generalization, and high computational overhead. Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline. Remarkably, it reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of dual-strategy coordination. Moreover, optional integration of expert demonstrations further boosts results, highlighting DuSAR's flexibility and compatibility with external knowledge.",2025-12-09 08:44:59+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08366v1
Conditional Morphogenesis: Emergent Generation of Structural Digits via Neural Cellular Automata,"Biological systems exhibit remarkable morphogenetic plasticity, where a single genome can encode various specialized cellular structures triggered by local chemical signals. In the domain of Deep Learning, Differentiable Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have emerged as a paradigm to mimic this self-organization. However, existing NCA research has predominantly focused on continuous texture synthesis or single-target object recovery, leaving the challenge of class-conditional structural generation largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Conditional Neural Cellular Automata (c-NCA) architecture capable of growing distinct topological structures - specifically MNIST digits - from a single generic seed, guided solely by a spatially broadcasted class vector. Unlike traditional generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) that rely on global reception fields, our model enforces strict locality and translation equivariance. We demonstrate that by injecting a one-hot condition into the cellular perception field, a single set of local rules can learn to break symmetry and self-assemble into ten distinct geometric attractors. Experimental results show that our c-NCA achieves stable convergence, correctly forming digit topologies from a single pixel, and exhibits robustness characteristic of biological systems. This work bridges the gap between texture-based NCAs and structural pattern formation, offering a lightweight, biologically plausible alternative for conditional generation.",2025-12-09 08:36:54+00:00,"['cs.NE', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08360v1
The High Cost of Incivility: Quantifying Interaction Inefficiency via Multi-Agent Monte Carlo Simulations,"Workplace toxicity is widely recognized as detrimental to organizational culture, yet quantifying its direct impact on operational efficiency remains methodologically challenging due to the ethical and practical difficulties of reproducing conflict in human subjects. This study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates, creating a controlled ""sociological sandbox"". We employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate hundrets of discussions, measuring the convergence time (defined as the number of arguments required to reach a conclusion) between a baseline control group and treatment groups involving agents with ""toxic"" system prompts. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of approximately 25\% in the duration of conversations involving toxic participants. We propose that this ""latency of toxicity"" serves as a proxy for financial damage in corporate and academic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that agent-based modeling provides a reproducible, ethical alternative to human-subject research for measuring the mechanics of social friction.",2025-12-09 08:17:35+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.CY', 'cs.MA']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08345v1
Enhancing Explainability of Graph Neural Networks Through Conceptual and Structural Analyses and Their Extensions,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing data with graph structures. The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning. The proposed framework aims to offer adaptable, computationally efficient explanations for GNNs, moving beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions.",2025-12-09 08:13:31+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.IT', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08344v1
Soil Compaction Parameters Prediction Based on Automated Machine Learning Approach,"Soil compaction is critical in construction engineering to ensure the stability of structures like road embankments and earth dams. Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoML in predicting compaction parameters across different soil types. The study also highlights the importance of heterogeneous datasets in improving the generalization and performance of ML models. Ultimately, this research contributes to more efficient and reliable construction practices by enhancing the prediction of soil compaction parameters.",2025-12-09 08:13:04+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08343v1
Predicting California Bearing Ratio with Ensemble and Neural Network Models: A Case Study from Türkiye,"The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is a key geotechnical indicator used to assess the load-bearing capacity of subgrade soils, especially in transportation infrastructure and foundation design. Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in Türkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks. The study supports the integration of intelligent, data-centric models in geotechnical engineering, offering an effective alternative to traditional methods and promoting digital transformation in infrastructure analysis and design.",2025-12-09 08:09:55+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08340v1
Robust Finetuning of Vision-Language-Action Robot Policies via Parameter Merging,"Generalist robot policies, trained on large and diverse datasets, have demonstrated the ability to generalize across a wide spectrum of behaviors, enabling a single policy to act in varied real-world environments. However, they still fall short on new tasks not covered in the training data. When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task. Moreover, we show that model merging enables continual acquisition of new skills in a lifelong learning setting, without sacrificing previously learned generalist abilities.",2025-12-09 08:02:11+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08333v1
Interpreting Structured Perturbations in Image Protection Methods for Diffusion Models,"Recent image protection mechanisms such as Glaze and Nightshade introduce imperceptible, adversarially designed perturbations intended to disrupt downstream text-to-image generative models. While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable. This work advances the interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs the design of future defenses and detection strategies for generative AI systems.",2025-12-09 07:55:11+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08329v1
Digital Modeling of Spatial Pathway Activity from Histology Reveals Tumor Microenvironment Heterogeneity,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables simultaneous mapping of tissue morphology and spatially resolved gene expression, offering unique opportunities to study tumor microenvironment heterogeneity. Here, we introduce a computational framework that predicts spatial pathway activity directly from hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained histology images at microscale resolution 55 and 100 um. Using image features derived from a computational pathology foundation model, we found that TGFb signaling was the most accurately predicted pathway across three independent breast and lung cancer ST datasets. In 87-88% of reliably predicted cases, the resulting spatial TGFb activity maps reflected the expected contrast between tumor and adjacent non-tumor regions, consistent with the known role of TGFb in regulating interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, linear and nonlinear predictive models performed similarly, suggesting that image features may relate to pathway activity in a predominantly linear fashion or that nonlinear structure is small relative to measurement noise. These findings demonstrate that features extracted from routine histopathology may recover spatially coherent and biologically interpretable pathway patterns, offering a scalable strategy for integrating image-based inference with ST information in tumor microenvironment studies.",2025-12-09 07:54:25+00:00,"['q-bio.QM', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09003v1
Argus: A Multi-Agent Sensitive Information Leakage Detection Framework Based on Hierarchical Reference Relationships,"Sensitive information leakage in code repositories has emerged as a critical security challenge. Traditional detection methods that rely on regular expressions, fingerprint features, and high-entropy calculations often suffer from high false-positive rates. This not only reduces detection efficiency but also significantly increases the manual screening burden on developers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent collaborative architectures have demonstrated remarkable potential for tackling complex tasks, offering a novel technological perspective for sensitive information detection. In response to these challenges, we propose Argus, a multi-agent collaborative framework for detecting sensitive information. Argus employs a three-tier detection mechanism that integrates key content, file context, and project reference relationships to effectively reduce false positives and enhance overall detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Argus in real-world repository environments, we developed two new benchmarks, one to assess genuine leak detection capabilities and another to evaluate false-positive filtering performance. Experimental results show that Argus achieves up to 94.86% accuracy in leak detection, with a precision of 96.36%, recall of 94.64%, and an F1 score of 0.955. Moreover, the analysis of 97 real repositories incurred a total cost of only 2.2$.

GeoDM: Geometry-aware Distribution Matching for Dataset Distillation,"Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact subset of the original data, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original large dataset. Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art data distillation methods and remains effective across various distribution-matching strategies for the single geometries.",2025-12-09 07:31:57+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08317v2
"Terrain Diffusion: A Diffusion-Based Successor to Perlin Noise in Infinite, Real-Time Terrain Generation","For decades, procedural worlds have been built on procedural noise functions such as Perlin noise, which are fast and infinite, yet fundamentally limited in realism and large-scale coherence. We introduce Terrain Diffusion, an AI-era successor to Perlin noise that bridges the fidelity of diffusion models with the properties that made procedural noise indispensable: seamless infinite extent, seed-consistency, and constant-time random access. At its core is InfiniteDiffusion, a novel algorithm for infinite generation, enabling seamless, real-time synthesis of boundless landscapes. A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges. An open-source infinite-tensor framework supports constant-memory manipulation of unbounded tensors, and few-step consistency distillation enables efficient generation. Together, these components establish diffusion models as a practical foundation for procedural world generation, capable of synthesizing entire planets coherently, controllably, and without limits.",2025-12-09 07:10:35+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.GR', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08309v1
rSIM: Incentivizing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs via Reinforced Strategy Injection,"Large language models (LLMs) are post-trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to evolve into Reasoning Language Models (RLMs), where the hallmark of this advanced reasoning is ``aha'' moments when they start to perform strategies, such as self-reflection and deep thinking, within chain of thoughts (CoTs). Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.",2025-12-09 06:55:39+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08300v1
Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems,"Agents, language model (LM)-based systems that are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting are becoming the dominant paradigm for real-world AI applications. Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties.",2025-12-09 06:52:21+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08296v1
Systematization of Knowledge: Security and Safety in the Model Context Protocol Ecosystem,"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as the de facto standard for connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to external data and tools, effectively functioning as the ""USB-C for Agentic AI."" While this decoupling of context and execution solves critical interoperability challenges, it introduces a profound new threat landscape where the boundary between epistemic errors (hallucinations) and security breaches (unauthorized actions) dissolves. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) aims to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of risks in the MCP ecosystem, distinguishing between adversarial security threats (e.g., indirect prompt injection, tool poisoning) and epistemic safety hazards (e.g., alignment failures in distributed tool delegation). We analyze the structural vulnerabilities of MCP primitives, specifically Resources, Prompts, and Tools, and demonstrate how ""context"" can be weaponized to trigger unauthorized operations in multi-agent environments. Furthermore, we survey state-of-the-art defenses, ranging from cryptographic provenance (ETDI) to runtime intent verification, and conclude with a roadmap for securing the transition from conversational chatbots to autonomous agentic operating systems.",2025-12-09 06:39:21+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08290v1
Empowering smart app development with SolidGPT: an edge-cloud hybrid AI agent framework,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into mobile and software development workflows faces a persistent tension among three demands: semantic awareness, developer productivity, and data privacy. Traditional cloud-based tools offer strong reasoning but risk data exposure and latency, while on-device solutions lack full-context understanding across codebase and developer tooling. We introduce SolidGPT, an open-source, edge-cloud hybrid developer assistant built on GitHub, designed to enhance code and workspace semantic search. SolidGPT enables developers to: talk to your codebase: interactively query code and project structure, discovering the right methods and modules without manual searching. Automate software project workflows: generate PRDs, task breakdowns, Kanban boards, and even scaffold web app beginnings, with deep integration via VSCode and Notion. Configure private, extensible agents: onboard private code folders (up to approximately 500 files), connect Notion, customize AI agent personas via embedding and in-context training, and deploy via Docker, CLI, or VSCode extension. In practice, SolidGPT empowers developer productivity through: Semantic-rich code navigation: no more hunting through files or wondering where a feature lives. Integrated documentation and task management: seamlessly sync generated PRD content and task boards into developer workflows. Privacy-first design: running locally via Docker or VSCode, with full control over code and data, while optionally reaching out to LLM APIs as needed.

Model-Based Diffusion Sampling for Predictive Control in Offline Decision Making,"Offline decision-making requires synthesizing reliable behaviors from fixed datasets without further interaction, yet existing generative approaches often yield trajectories that are dynamically infeasible. We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional model-based diffusion framework consisting of: (i) a planner that generates diverse, task-aligned trajectories; (ii) a dynamics model that enforces consistency with the underlying system dynamics; and (iii) a ranker module that selects behaviors aligned with the task objectives. MPDiffuser employs an alternating diffusion sampling scheme, where planner and dynamics updates are interleaved to progressively refine trajectories for both task alignment and feasibility during the sampling process. We also provide a theoretical rationale for this procedure, showing how it balances fidelity to data priors with dynamics consistency. Empirically, the compositional design improves sample efficiency, as it leverages even low-quality data for dynamics learning and adapts seamlessly to novel dynamics. We evaluate MPDiffuser on both unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) offline decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains over existing approaches.

"A Physics-Constrained, Design-Driven Methodology for Defect Dataset Generation in Optical Lithography","The efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in micro/nano manufacturing is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of high-quality and physically grounded training data for defect inspection. Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN. These consistent gains demonstrate that our proposed methodology to generate defect datasets with pixel-level annotations is feasible for robust AI-based Measurement/Inspection (MI) in semiconductor fabrication.",2025-12-09 06:13:33+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09001v1
AgentEval: Generative Agents as Reliable Proxies for Human Evaluation of AI-Generated Content,"Modern businesses are increasingly challenged by the time and expense required to generate and assess high-quality content. Human writers face time constraints, and extrinsic evaluations can be costly. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential in content creation, concerns about the quality of AI-generated content persist. Traditional evaluation methods, like human surveys, further add operational costs, highlighting the need for efficient, automated solutions. This research introduces Generative Agents as a means to tackle these challenges. These agents can rapidly and cost-effectively evaluate AI-generated content, simulating human judgment by rating aspects such as coherence, interestingness, clarity, fairness, and relevance. By incorporating these agents, businesses can streamline content generation and ensure consistent, high-quality output while minimizing reliance on costly human evaluations. The study provides critical insights into enhancing LLMs for producing business-aligned, high-quality content, offering significant advancements in automated content generation and evaluation.",2025-12-09 06:03:25+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08273v1

Reasoning Models Ace the CFA Exams,"Previous research has reported that large language models (LLMs) demonstrate poor performance on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exams. However, recent reasoning models have achieved strong results on graduate-level academic and professional examinations across various disciplines. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art reasoning models on a set of mock CFA exams consisting of 980 questions across three Level I exams, two Level II exams, and three Level III exams. Using the same pass/fail criteria from prior studies, we find that most models clear all three levels. The models that pass, ordered by overall performance, are Gemini 3.0 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, Claude Opus 4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1. Specifically, Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves a record score of 97.6% on Level I. Performance is also strong on Level II, led by GPT-5 at 94.3%. On Level III, Gemini 2.5 Pro attains the highest score with 86.4% on multiple-choice questions while Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves 92.0% on constructed-response questions.",2025-12-09 05:57:19+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'q-fin.GN']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08270v1
"RLCNet: An end-to-end deep learning framework for simultaneous online calibration of LiDAR, RADAR, and Camera","Accurate extrinsic calibration of LiDAR, RADAR, and camera sensors is essential for reliable perception in autonomous vehicles. Still, it remains challenging due to factors such as mechanical vibrations and cumulative sensor drift in dynamic environments. This paper presents RLCNet, a novel end-to-end trainable deep learning framework for the simultaneous online calibration of these multimodal sensors. Validated on real-world datasets, RLCNet is designed for practical deployment and demonstrates robust performance under diverse conditions. To support real-time operation, an online calibration framework is introduced that incorporates a weighted moving average and outlier rejection, enabling dynamic adjustment of calibration parameters with reduced prediction noise and improved resilience to drift.

Beyond Traditional Diagnostics: Transforming Patient-Side Information into Predictive Insights with Knowledge Graphs and Prototypes,"Predicting diseases solely from patient-side information, such as demographics and self-reported symptoms, has attracted significant research attention due to its potential to enhance patient awareness, facilitate early healthcare engagement, and improve healthcare system efficiency. However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery.",2025-12-09 05:37:54+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08261v1
Learning Spatiotemporal Tubes for Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Tasks using Physics-Informed Neural Networks,"This paper presents a Spatiotemporal Tube (STT)-based control framework for general control-affine MIMO nonlinear pure-feedback systems with unknown dynamics to satisfy prescribed time reach-avoid-stay tasks under external disturbances. The STT is defined as a time-varying ball, whose center and radius are jointly approximated by a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The constraints governing the STT are first formulated as loss functions of the PINN, and a training algorithm is proposed to minimize the overall violation. The PINN being trained on certain collocation points, we propose a Lipschitz-based validity condition to formally verify that the learned PINN satisfies the conditions over the continuous time horizon. Building on the learned STT representation, an approximation-free closed-form controller is defined to guarantee satisfaction of the T-RAS specification. Finally, the effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through two case studies involving a mobile robot and an aerial vehicle navigating through cluttered environments.",2025-12-09 05:08:52+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08248v1
Distilling Future Temporal Knowledge with Masked Feature Reconstruction for 3D Object Detection,"Camera-based temporal 3D object detection has shown impressive results in autonomous driving, with offline models improving accuracy by using future frames. Knowledge distillation (KD) can be an appealing framework for transferring rich information from offline models to online models. However, existing KD methods overlook future frames, as they mainly focus on spatial feature distillation under strict frame alignment or on temporal relational distillation, thereby making it challenging for online models to effectively learn future knowledge. To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context. FTKD is applied to two high-performing 3D object detection baselines, achieving up to 1.3 mAP and 1.3 NDS gains on the nuScenes dataset, as well as the most accurate velocity estimation, without increasing inference cost.",2025-12-09 05:01:29+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08247v1
Residual-SwinCA-Net: A Channel-Aware Integrated Residual CNN-Swin Transformer for Malignant Lesion Segmentation in BUSI,"A novel deep hybrid Residual-SwinCA-Net segmentation framework is proposed in the study for addressing such challenges by extracting locally correlated and robust features, incorporating residual CNN modules. Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference. The Residual-SwinCA-Net and existing CNNs/ViTs techniques have been implemented on the publicly available BUSI dataset. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework outperformed and achieved 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice for breast lesion segmentation. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework improves the BUSI lesion diagnostic performance and strengthens timely clinical decision-making.",2025-12-09 04:52:30+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08243v1
HybridToken-VLM: Hybrid Token Compression for Vision-Language Models,"Vision-language models (VLMs) have transformed multimodal reasoning, but feeding hundreds of visual patch tokens into LLMs incurs quadratic computational costs, straining memory and context windows. Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations. HTC-VLM achieves an average performance retention of 87.2 percent across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming the leading continuous baseline at 81.0 percent with a 580-to-1 compression ratio. Attention analyses show that the compressed token prioritizes the discrete anchor, validating its semantic guidance. Our work demonstrates that a minimalist hybrid design can resolve the efficiency-fidelity dilemma and advance scalable VLMs.",2025-12-09 04:48:38+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08240v1
SpeechQualityLLM: LLM-Based Multimodal Assessment of Speech Quality,"Objective speech quality assessment is central to telephony, VoIP, and streaming systems, where large volumes of degraded audio must be monitored and optimized at scale. Classical metrics such as PESQ and POLQA approximate human mean opinion scores (MOS) but require carefully controlled conditions and expensive listening tests, while learning-based models such as NISQA regress MOS and multiple perceptual dimensions from waveforms or spectrograms, achieving high correlation with subjective ratings yet remaining rigid: they do not support interactive, natural-language queries and do not natively provide textual rationales. In this work, we introduce SpeechQualityLLM, a multimodal speech quality question-answering (QA) system that couples an audio encoder with a language model and is trained on the NISQA corpus using template-based question-answer pairs covering overall MOS and four perceptual dimensions (noisiness, coloration, discontinuity, and loudness) in both single-ended (degraded only) and double-ended (degraded plus clean reference) setups. Instead of directly regressing scores, our system is supervised to generate textual answers from which numeric predictions are parsed and evaluated with standard regression and ranking metrics; on held-out NISQA clips, the double-ended model attains a MOS mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41 with Pearson correlation of 0.86, with competitive performance on dimension-wise tasks. Beyond these quantitative gains, it offers a flexible natural-language interface in which the language model acts as an audio quality expert: practitioners can query arbitrary aspects of degradations, prompt the model to emulate different listener profiles to capture human variability and produce diverse but plausible judgments rather than a single deterministic score, and thereby reduce reliance on large-scale crowdsourced tests and their monetary cost.",2025-12-09 04:39:50+00:00,"['cs.SD', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08238v1
Semantic-Metric Bayesian Risk Fields: Learning Robot Safety from Human Videos with a VLM Prior,"Humans interpret safety not as a binary signal but as a continuous, context- and spatially-dependent notion of risk. While risk is subjective, humans form rational mental models that guide action selection in dynamic environments. This work proposes a framework for extracting implicit human risk models by introducing a novel, semantically-conditioned and spatially-varying parametrization of risk, supervised directly from safe human demonstration videos and VLM common sense. Notably, we define risk through a Bayesian formulation. The prior is furnished by a pretrained vision-language model. In order to encourage the risk estimate to be more human aligned, a likelihood function modulates the prior to produce a relative metric of risk. Specifically, the likelihood is a learned ViT that maps pretrained features, to pixel-aligned risk values. Our pipeline ingests RGB images and a query object string, producing pixel-dense risk images. These images that can then be used as value-predictors in robot planning tasks or be projected into 3D for use in conventional trajectory optimization to produce human-like motion. This learned mapping enables generalization to novel objects and contexts, and has the potential to scale to much larger training datasets. In particular, the Bayesian framework that is introduced enables fast adaptation of our model to additional observations or common sense rules. We demonstrate that our proposed framework produces contextual risk that aligns with human preferences. Additionally, we illustrate several downstream applications of the model; as a value learner for visuomotor planners or in conjunction with a classical trajectory optimization algorithm. Our results suggest that our framework is a significant step toward enabling autonomous systems to internalize human-like risk.

Empowerment Gain and Causal Model Construction: Children and adults are sensitive to controllability and variability in their causal interventions,"Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called ""empowerment"" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. ""Empowerment"" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.",2025-12-09 04:14:48+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08230v1
Geometry-Aware Sparse Depth Sampling for High-Fidelity RGB-D Depth Completion in Robotic Systems,"Accurate three-dimensional perception is essential for modern industrial robotic systems that perform manipulation, inspection, and navigation tasks. RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics. Experiments show that our geometry-aware sparse depth improves accuracy, reduces artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and produces more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior.",2025-12-09 04:14:05+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.RO']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08229v1
MM-CoT:A Benchmark for Probing Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Models,"The ability to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning marks a major milestone for multimodal models (MMs), enabling them to solve complex visual reasoning problems. Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning. This benchmark provides a foundation for developing future models that reason not just plausibly, but faithfully and coherently within the visual world.",2025-12-09 04:13:31+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08228v1
PR-CapsNet: Pseudo-Riemannian Capsule Network with Adaptive Curvature Routing for Graph Learning,"Capsule Networks (CapsNets) show exceptional graph representation capacity via dynamic routing and vectorized hierarchical representations, but they model the complex geometries of real\-world graphs poorly by fixed\-curvature space due to the inherent geodesical disconnectedness issues, leading to suboptimal performance. Recent works find that non\-Euclidean pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds provide specific inductive biases for embedding graph data, but how to leverage them to improve CapsNets is still underexplored. Here, we extend the Euclidean capsule routing into geodesically disconnected pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds and derive a Pseudo\-Riemannian Capsule Network (PR\-CapsNet), which models data in pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds of adaptive curvature, for graph representation learning. Specifically, PR\-CapsNet enhances the CapsNet with Adaptive Pseudo\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing by utilizing pseudo\-Riemannian geometry. Unlike single\-curvature or subspace\-partitioning methods, PR\-CapsNet concurrently models hierarchical and cluster or cyclic graph structures via its versatile pseudo\-Riemannian metric. It first deploys Pseudo\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing to decompose capsule states into spherical\-temporal and Euclidean\-spatial subspaces with diffeomorphic transformations. Then, an Adaptive Curvature Routing is developed to adaptively fuse features from different curvature spaces for complex graphs via a learnable curvature tensor with geometric attention from local manifold properties. Finally, a geometric properties\-preserved Pseudo\-Riemannian Capsule Classifier is developed to project capsule embeddings to tangent spaces and use curvature\-weighted softmax for classification. Extensive experiments on node and graph classification benchmarks show PR\-CapsNet outperforms SOTA models, validating PR\-CapsNet's strong representation power for complex graph structures.",2025-12-09 03:54:51+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08218v1
High-Performance Dual-Arm Task and Motion Planning for Tabletop Rearrangement,"We propose Synchronous Dual-Arm Rearrangement Planner (SDAR), a task and motion planning (TAMP) framework for tabletop rearrangement, where two robot arms equipped with 2-finger grippers must work together in close proximity to rearrange objects whose start and goal configurations are strongly entangled. To tackle such challenges, SDAR tightly knit together its dependency-driven task planner (SDAR-T) and synchronous dual-arm motion planner (SDAR-M), to intelligently sift through a large number of possible task and motion plans. Specifically, SDAR-T applies a simple yet effective strategy to decompose the global object dependency graph induced by the rearrangement task, to produce more optimal dual-arm task plans than solutions derived from optimal task plans for a single arm. Leveraging state-of-the-art GPU SIMD-based motion planning tools, SDAR-M employs a layered motion planning strategy to sift through many task plans for the best synchronous dual-arm motion plan while ensuring high levels of success rate. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SDAR delivers a 100% success rate in solving complex, non-monotone, long-horizon tabletop rearrangement tasks with solution quality far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art. Experiments on two UR-5e arms further confirm SDAR directly and reliably transfers to robot hardware.",2025-12-09 03:33:34+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08206v1

Embodied Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Manipulation Planning with Embodied World Model,"World models have emerged as a pivotal component in robot manipulation planning, enabling agents to predict future environmental states and reason about the consequences of actions before execution. While video-generation models are increasingly adopted, they often lack rigorous physical grounding, leading to hallucinations and a failure to maintain consistency in long-horizon physical constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Embodied Tree of Thoughts (EToT), a novel Real2Sim2Real planning framework that leverages a physics-based interactive digital twin as an embodied world model. EToT formulates manipulation planning as a tree search expanded through two synergistic mechanisms: (1) Priori Branching, which generates diverse candidate execution paths based on semantic and spatial analysis; and (2) Reflective Branching, which utilizes VLMs to diagnose execution failures within the simulator and iteratively refine the planning tree with corrective actions. By grounding high-level reasoning in a physics simulator, our framework ensures that generated plans adhere to rigid-body dynamics and collision constraints. We validate EToT on a suite of short- and long-horizon manipulation tasks, where it consistently outperforms baselines by effectively predicting physical dynamics and adapting to potential failures.

"Ground Slow, Move Fast: A Dual-System Foundation Model for Generalizable Vision-and-Language Navigation","While recent large vision-language models (VLMs) have improved generalization in vision-language navigation (VLN), existing methods typically rely on end-to-end pipelines that map vision-language inputs directly to short-horizon discrete actions. Such designs often produce fragmented motions, incur high latency, and struggle with real-world challenges like dynamic obstacle avoidance. We propose DualVLN, the first dual-system VLN foundation model that synergistically integrates high-level reasoning with low-level action execution. System 2, a VLM-based global planner, ""grounds slowly"" by predicting mid-term waypoint goals via image-grounded reasoning. System 1, a lightweight, multi-modal conditioning Diffusion Transformer policy, ""moves fast"" by leveraging both explicit pixel goals and latent features from System 2 to generate smooth and accurate trajectories.

We propose a practical, fully reproducible framework for evaluating medical AI security under realistic resource constraints. Our framework design covers multiple medical specialties stratified by clinical risk -- from high-risk domains such as emergency medicine and psychiatry to general practice -- addressing jailbreaking attacks (role-playing, authority impersonation, multi-turn manipulation) and privacy extraction attacks. All evaluation utilizes synthetic patient records requiring no IRB approval. The framework is designed to run entirely on consumer CPU hardware using freely available models, eliminating cost barriers.

To enhance accuracy, we quantitatively analyze the impact of feature distribution on calibration results and adaptively weight the cost of each feature based on these metrics. As a result, extrinsic parameters are optimized by filtering out the adverse effects of inferior features. We validated our method through extensive experiments across various LiDAR-camera sensors in both indoor and outdoor settings.

Information-Dense Reasoning for Efficient and Auditable Security Alert Triage,"Security Operations Centers face massive, heterogeneous alert streams under minute-level service windows, creating the Alert Triage Latency Paradox: verbose reasoning chains ensure accuracy and compliance but incur prohibitive latency and token costs, while minimal chains sacrifice transparency and auditability. Existing solutions fail: signature systems are brittle, anomaly methods lack actionability, and fully cloud-hosted LLMs raise latency, cost, and privacy concerns. We propose AIDR, a hybrid cloud-edge framework that addresses this trade-off through constrained information-density optimization. The core innovation is gradient-based compression of reasoning chains to retain only decision-critical steps--minimal evidence sufficient to justify predictions while respecting token and latency budgets. We demonstrate that this approach preserves decision-relevant information while minimizing complexity. We construct compact datasets by distilling alerts into 3-5 high-information bullets (68% token reduction), train domain-specialized experts via LoRA, and deploy a cloud-edge architecture: a cloud LLM routes alerts to on-premises experts generating SOAR-ready JSON. Experiments demonstrate AIDR achieves higher accuracy and 40.6% latency reduction versus Chain-of-Thought, with robustness to data corruption and out-of-distribution generalization, enabling auditable and efficient SOC triage with full data residency compliance.",2025-12-09 01:57:24+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08169v1
LayerPipe2: Multistage Pipelining and Weight Recompute via Improved Exponential Moving Average for Training Neural Networks,"In our prior work, LayerPipe, we had introduced an approach to accelerate training of convolutional, fully connected, and spiking neural networks by overlapping forward and backward computation. However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs.",2025-12-09 01:35:08+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.AR']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08160v1
TreeGRPO: Tree-Advantage GRPO for Online RL Post-Training of Diffusion Models,"Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is crucial for aligning generative models with human preferences, but its prohibitive computational cost remains a major barrier to widespread adoption. We introduce \textbf{TreeGRPO}, a novel RL framework that dramatically improves training efficiency by recasting the denoising process as a search tree. From shared initial noise samples, TreeGRPO strategically branches to generate multiple candidate trajectories while efficiently reusing their common prefixes. This tree-structured approach delivers three key advantages: (1) \emph{High sample efficiency}, achieving better performance under same training samples (2) \emph{Fine-grained credit assignment} via reward backpropagation that computes step-specific advantages, overcoming the uniform credit assignment limitation of trajectory-based methods, and (3) \emph{Amortized computation} where multi-child branching enables multiple policy updates per forward pass. Extensive experiments on both diffusion and flow-based models demonstrate that TreeGRPO achieves \textbf{2.4$\times$ faster training} while establishing a superior Pareto frontier in the efficiency-reward trade-off space. Our method consistently outperforms GRPO baselines across multiple benchmarks and reward models, providing a scalable and effective pathway for RL-based visual generative model alignment.

Scalable Back-End for an AI-Based Diabetes Prediction Application,"The rising global prevalence of diabetes necessitates early detection to prevent severe complications. While AI-powered prediction applications offer a promising solution, they require a responsive and scalable back-end architecture to serve a large user base effectively. This paper details the development and evaluation of a scalable back-end system designed for a mobile diabetes prediction application. The primary objective was to maintain a failure rate below 5% and an average latency of under 1000 ms. The architecture leverages horizontal scaling, database sharding, and asynchronous communication via a message queue. Performance evaluation showed that 83% of the system's features (20 out of 24) met the specified performance targets. Key functionalities such as user profile management, activity tracking, and read-intensive prediction operations successfully achieved the desired performance. The system demonstrated the ability to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without issues, validating its scalability. The implementation of asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ proved crucial in minimizing the error rate for computationally intensive prediction requests, ensuring system reliability by queuing requests and preventing data loss under heavy load.",2025-12-09 00:59:20+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.SE']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08147v1
Chat with UAV -- Human-UAV Interaction Based on Large Language Models,"The future of UAV interaction systems is evolving from engineer-driven to user-driven, aiming to replace traditional predefined Human-UAV Interaction designs. This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring. However, due to the lack of a common language between users and the UAVs, such interactions are often difficult to be achieved. The developments of Large Language Models possess the ability to understand nature languages and Robots' (UAVs') behaviors, marking the possibility of personalized Human-UAV Interaction. Recently, some HUI frameworks based on LLMs have been proposed, but they commonly suffer from difficulties in mixed task planning and execution, leading to low adaptability in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-agent HUI framework. This framework constructs two independent LLM agents (a task planning agent, and an execution agent) and applies different Prompt Engineering to separately handle the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks. To verify the effectiveness and performance of the framework, we have built a task database covering four typical application scenarios of UAVs and quantified the performance of the HUI framework using three independent metrics. Meanwhile different LLM models are selected to control the UAVs with compared performance. Our user study experimental results demonstrate that the framework improves the smoothness of HUI and the flexibility of task execution in the tasks scenario we set up, effectively meeting users' personalized needs.",2025-12-09 00:55:40+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08145v1

Biothreat Benchmark Generation Framework for Evaluating Frontier AI Models I: The Task-Query Architecture,"Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate the risk of rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons. An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities.",2025-12-09 00:16:44+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08130v1
Long-only cryptocurrency portfolio management by ranking the assets: a neural network approach,"This paper will propose a novel machine learning based portfolio management method in the context of the cryptocurrency market. Previous researchers mainly focus on the prediction of the movement for specific cryptocurrency such as the bitcoin(BTC) and then trade according to the prediction. In contrast to the previous work that treats the cryptocurrencies independently, this paper manages a group of cryptocurrencies by analyzing the relative relationship. Specifically, in each time step, we utilize the neural network to predict the rank of the future return of the managed cryptocurrencies and place weights accordingly. By incorporating such cross-sectional information, the proposed methods is shown to profitable based on the backtesting experiments on the real daily cryptocurrency market data from May, 2020 to Nov, 2023. During this 3.5 years, the market experiences the full cycle of bullish, bearish and stagnant market conditions. Despite under such complex market conditions, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.01 and annualized return of 64.26%. Additionally, the proposed method is shown to be robust to the increase of transaction fee.",2025-12-09 00:08:39+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.NE']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08124v1
Balanced Accuracy: The Right Metric for Evaluating LLM Judges -- Explained through Youden's J statistic,"Rigorous evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies on comparing models by the prevalence of desirable or undesirable behaviors, such as task pass rates or policy violations. These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection.",2025-12-08 23:58:32+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08121v1
Scalable Offline Model-Based RL with Action Chunks,"In this paper, we study whether model-based reinforcement learning (RL), in particular model-based value expansion, can provide a scalable recipe for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks in offline RL. Model-based value expansion fits an on-policy value function using length-n imaginary rollouts generated by the current policy and a learned dynamics model. While larger n reduces bias in value bootstrapping, it amplifies accumulated model errors over long horizons, degrading future predictions. We address this trade-off with an \emph{action-chunk} model that predicts a future state from a sequence of actions (an ""action chunk"") instead of a single action, which reduces compounding errors. In addition, instead of directly training a policy to maximize rewards, we employ rejection sampling from an expressive behavioral action-chunk policy, which prevents model exploitation from out-of-distribution actions. We call this recipe \textbf{Model-Based RL with Action Chunks (MAC)}. Through experiments on highly challenging tasks with large-scale datasets of up to 100M transitions, we show that MAC achieves the best performance among offline model-based RL algorithms, especially on challenging long-horizon tasks.",2025-12-08 23:26:29+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08108v1
Training LLMs for Honesty via Confessions,"Large language models (LLMs) can be dishonest when reporting on their actions and beliefs -- for example, they may overstate their confidence in factual claims or cover up evidence of covert actions. Such dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie or misrepresent its actions.
  In this work we propose a method for eliciting an honest expression of an LLM's shortcomings via a self-reported *confession*. A confession is an output, provided upon request after a model's original answer, that is meant to serve as a full account of the model's compliance with the letter and spirit of its policies and instructions. The reward assigned to a confession during training is solely based on its honesty, and does not impact positively or negatively the main answer's reward. As long as the ""path of least resistance"" for maximizing confession reward is to surface misbehavior rather than covering it up, this incentivizes models to be honest in their confessions. Our findings provide some justification this empirical assumption, especially in the case of egregious model misbehavior.
  To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we train GPT-5-Thinking to produce confessions, and we evaluate its honesty in out-of-distribution scenarios measuring hallucination, instruction following, scheming, and reward hacking. We find that when the model lies or omits shortcomings in its ""main"" answer, it often confesses to these behaviors honestly, and this confession honesty modestly improves with training. Confessions can enable a number of inference-time interventions including monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to the user.",2025-12-08 23:05:52+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08093v1
Short-Context Dominance: How Much Local Context Natural Language Actually Needs?,"We investigate the short-context dominance hypothesis: that for most sequences, a small local prefix suffices to predict their next tokens. Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant. Across Q&A tasks and model architectures, we confirm that mitigating the bias improves performance.",2025-12-08 22:25:00+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08082v1
Large Language Models for Education and Research: An Empirical and User Survey-based Analysis,"Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, with education and research emerging as particularly impactful areas.

Joint Activity Design Heuristics for Enhancing Human-Machine Collaboration,"Joint activity describes when more than one agent (human or machine) contributes to the completion of a task or activity. Designing for joint activity focuses on explicitly supporting the interdependencies between agents necessary for effective coordination among agents engaged in the joint activity. This builds and expands upon designing for usability to further address how technologies can be designed to act as effective team players. Effective joint activity requires supporting, at minimum, five primary macrocognitive functions within teams: Event Detection, Sensemaking, Adaptability, Perspective-Shifting, and Coordination. Supporting these functions is equally as important as making technologies usable. We synthesized fourteen heuristics from relevant literature including display design, human factors, cognitive systems engineering, cognitive psychology, and computer science to aid the design, development, and evaluation of technologies that support joint human-machine activity.",2025-12-08 20:53:57+00:00,"['cs.HC', 'cs.AI', 'eess.SY']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08036v1

To mitigate this risk further, we introduce an autonomous navigation framework that utilizes a local Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map for obstacle avoidance while maintaining swarm formation with minimal path deviation. Additionally, we incorporate a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) variant to optimize area coverage, prioritizing Points of Interest (POIs) based on preassigned values derived from environmental behavior and critical infrastructure.

Toward an AI Reasoning-Enabled System for Patient-Clinical Trial Matching,"Screening patients for clinical trial eligibility remains a manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process. We present a secure, scalable proof-of-concept system for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-augmented patient-trial matching that addresses key implementation challenges: integrating heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data, facilitating expert review, and maintaining rigorous security standards. Leveraging open-source, reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs), the system moves beyond binary classification to generate structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains that support human-in-the-loop review. This decision support tool represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations that could render a patient eligible in the future.

FRIEDA: Benchmarking Multi-Step Cartographic Reasoning in Vision-Language Models,"Cartographic reasoning is the skill of interpreting geographic relationships by aligning legends, map scales, compass directions, map texts, and geometries across one or more map images. Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning. We evaluate eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs under two settings: (1) the direct setting, where we provide the maps relevant to the question, and (2) the contextual setting, where the model may have to identify the maps relevant to the question before reasoning. Even the strongest models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think, achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy, respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%. These results reveal a persistent gap in multi-step cartographic reasoning, positioning FRIEDA as a rigorous benchmark to drive progress on spatial intelligence in LVLMs.",2025-12-08 20:18:15+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08016v1

DIJIT is also being used to explore the differences between how human vision employs eye/head movements to solve visual tasks and current computer vision methods. DIJIT's design features nine mechanical degrees of freedom, while the cameras and lenses provide an additional four optical degrees of freedom. The ranges and speeds of the mechanical design are comparable to human performance. Our design includes the ranges of motion required for convergent stereo, namely, vergence, version, and cyclotorsion. The exploration of the utility of these to both human and machine vision is ongoing. Here, we present the design of DIJIT and evaluate aspects of its performance.

SkipKV: Selective Skipping of KV Generation and Storage for Efficient Inference with Large Reasoning Models,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) often cost significant key-value (KV) cache overhead, due to their linear growth with the verbose chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process. This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \textbf{SkipKV}, a \textbf{\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \textit{eviction} and \textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\mathbf{26.7}\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget. Additionally, compared to SoTA, SkipKV yields up to $\mathbf{1.6}\times$ fewer generation length while improving throughput up to $\mathbf{1.7}\times$.",2025-12-08 19:32:06+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07993v1
A Gray Literature Study on Fairness Requirements in AI-enabled Software Engineering,"Today, with the growing obsession with applying Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML), to software across various contexts, much of the focus has been on the effectiveness of AI models, often measured through common metrics such as F1- score, while fairness receives relatively little attention. This paper presents a review of existing gray literature, examining fairness requirements in AI context, with a focus on how they are defined across various application domains, managed throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and the causes, as well as the corresponding consequences of their violation by AI models. Our gray literature investigation shows various definitions of fairness requirements in AI systems, commonly emphasizing non-discrimination and equal treatment across different demographic and social attributes. Fairness requirement management practices vary across the SDLC, particularly in model training and bias mitigation, fairness monitoring and evaluation, and data handling practices. Fairness requirement violations are frequently linked, but not limited, to data representation bias, algorithmic and model design bias, human judgment, and evaluation and transparency gaps. The corresponding consequences include harm in a broad sense, encompassing specific professional and societal impacts as key examples, stereotype reinforcement, data and privacy risks, and loss of trust and legitimacy in AI-supported decisions. These findings emphasize the need for consistent frameworks and practices to integrate fairness into AI software, paying as much attention to fairness as to effectiveness.",2025-12-08 19:22:01+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07990v1
Restrictive Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation for Stratified Tooth Layer Detection,"Accurate understanding of anatomical structures is essential for reliably staging certain dental diseases. A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes.",2025-12-08 19:15:08+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07984v1
An Empirical Framework for Evaluating Semantic Preservation Using Hugging Face,"As machine learning (ML) becomes an integral part of high-autonomy systems, it is critical to ensure the trustworthiness of learning-enabled software systems (LESS). Yet, the nondeterministic and run-time-defined semantics of ML complicate traditional software refactoring. We define semantic preservation in LESS as the property that optimizations of intelligent components do not alter the system's overall functional behavior. This paper introduces an empirical framework to evaluate semantic preservation in LESS by mining model evolution data from HuggingFace. We extract commit histories, $\textit{Model Cards}$, and performance metrics from a large number of models. To establish baselines, we conducted case studies in three domains, tracing performance changes across versions. Our analysis demonstrates how $\textit{semantic drift}$ can be detected via evaluation metrics across commits and reveals common refactoring patterns based on commit message analysis. Although API constraints limited the possibility of estimating a full-scale threshold, our pipeline offers a foundation for defining community-accepted boundaries for semantic preservation. Our contributions include: (1) a large-scale dataset of ML model evolution, curated from 1.7 million Hugging Face entries via a reproducible pipeline using the native HF hub API, (2) a practical pipeline for the evaluation of semantic preservation for a subset of 536 models and 4000+ metrics and (3) empirical case studies illustrating semantic drift in practice. Together, these contributions advance the foundations for more maintainable and trustworthy ML systems.",2025-12-08 19:14:21+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07983v1
VLD: Visual Language Goal Distance for Reinforcement Learning Navigation,"Training end-to-end policies from image data to directly predict navigation actions for robotic systems has proven inherently difficult. Existing approaches often suffer from either the sim-to-real gap during policy transfer or a limited amount of training data with action labels. To address this problem, we introduce Vision-Language Distance (VLD) learning, a scalable framework for goal-conditioned navigation that decouples perception learning from policy learning. Instead of relying on raw sensory inputs during policy training, we first train a self-supervised distance-to-goal predictor on internet-scale video data. This predictor generalizes across both image- and text-based goals, providing a distance signal that can be minimized by a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. The RL policy can be trained entirely in simulation using privileged geometric distance signals, with injected noise to mimic the uncertainty of the trained distance predictor. At deployment, the policy consumes VLD predictions, inheriting semantic goal information-""where to go""-from large-scale visual training while retaining the robust low-level navigation behaviors learned in simulation. We propose using ordinal consistency to assess distance functions directly and demonstrate that VLD outperforms prior temporal distance approaches, such as ViNT and VIP. Experiments show that our decoupled design achieves competitive navigation performance in simulation while supporting flexible goal modalities, providing an alternative and, most importantly, scalable path toward reliable, multimodal navigation policies.",2025-12-08 19:05:51+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.CV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07976v1
Sparse Variable Projection in Robotic Perception: Exploiting Separable Structure for Efficient Nonlinear Optimization,"Robotic perception often requires solving large nonlinear least-squares (NLS) problems. While sparsity has been well-exploited to scale solvers, a complementary and underexploited structure is \emph{separability} -- where some variables (e.g., visual landmarks) appear linearly in the residuals and, for any estimate of the remaining variables (e.g., poses), have a closed-form solution. Variable projection (VarPro) methods are a family of techniques that exploit this structure by analytically eliminating the linear variables and presenting a reduced problem in the remaining variables that has favorable properties. However, VarPro has seen limited use in robotic perception; a major challenge arises from gauge symmetries (e.g., cost invariance to global shifts and rotations), which are common in perception and induce specific computational challenges in standard VarPro approaches. We present a VarPro scheme designed for problems with gauge symmetries that jointly exploits separability and sparsity. Our method can be applied as a one-time preprocessing step to construct a \emph{matrix-free Schur complement operator}. This operator allows efficient evaluation of costs, gradients, and Hessian-vector products of the reduced problem and readily integrates with standard iterative NLS solvers. We provide precise conditions under which our method applies, and describe extensions when these conditions are only partially met. Across synthetic and real benchmarks in SLAM, SNL, and SfM, our approach achieves up to \textbf{2$\times$--35$\times$ faster runtimes} than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy.

Relational Visual Similarity,"Humans do not just see attribute similarity -- we also see relational similarity. An apple is like a peach because both are reddish fruit, but the Earth is also like a peach: its crust, mantle, and core correspond to the peach's skin, flesh, and pit. This ability to perceive and recognize relational similarity, is arguable by cognitive scientist to be what distinguishes humans from other species. Yet, all widely used visual similarity metrics today (e.g., LPIPS, CLIP, DINO) focus solely on perceptual attribute similarity and fail to capture the rich, often surprising relational similarities that humans perceive. How can we go beyond the visible content of an image to capture its relational properties? How can we bring images with the same relational logic closer together in representation space? To answer these questions, we first formulate relational image similarity as a measurable problem: two images are relationally similar when their internal relations or functions among visual elements correspond, even if their visual attributes differ. We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance. Our study shows that while relational similarity has a lot of real-world applications, existing image similarity models fail to capture it -- revealing a critical gap in visual computing.",2025-12-08 18:59:56+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07833v1
"Can AI autonomously build, operate, and use the entire data stack?","Enterprise data management is a monumental task. It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems.",2025-12-08 18:59:01+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.DB', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07926v1
One Layer Is Enough: Adapting Pretrained Visual Encoders for Image Generation,"Visual generative models (e.g., diffusion models) typically operate in compressed latent spaces to balance training efficiency and sample quality. In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning.",2025-12-08 18:57:26+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07829v1
Near-real time fires detection using satellite imagery in Sudan conflict,"The challenges of ongoing war in Sudan highlight the need for rapid monitoring and analysis of such conflicts. Advances in deep learning and readily available satellite remote sensing imagery allow for near real-time monitoring. This paper uses 4-band imagery from Planet Labs with a deep learning model to show that fire damage in armed conflicts can be monitored with minimal delay. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five case studies in Sudan. We show that, compared to a baseline, the automated method captures the active fires and charred areas more accurately. Our results indicate that using 8-band imagery or time series of such imagery only result in marginal gains.",2025-12-08 18:55:34+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07925v1
WorldReel: 4D Video Generation with Consistent Geometry and Motion Modeling,"Recent video generators achieve striking photorealism, yet remain fundamentally inconsistent in 3D. We present WorldReel, a 4D video generator that is natively spatio-temporally consistent. WorldReel jointly produces RGB frames together with 4D scene representations, including pointmaps, camera trajectory, and dense flow mapping, enabling coherent geometry and appearance modeling over time. Our explicit 4D representation enforces a single underlying scene that persists across viewpoints and dynamic content, yielding videos that remain consistent even under large non-rigid motion and significant camera movement. We train WorldReel by carefully combining synthetic and real data: synthetic data providing precise 4D supervision (geometry, motion, and camera), while real videos contribute visual diversity and realism. This blend allows WorldReel to generalize to in-the-wild footage while preserving strong geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WorldReel sets a new state-of-the-art for consistent video generation with dynamic scenes and moving cameras, improving metrics of geometric consistency, motion coherence, and reducing view-time artifacts over competing methods. We believe that WorldReel brings video generation closer to 4D-consistent world modeling, where agents can render, interact, and reason about scenes through a single and stable spatiotemporal representation.",2025-12-08 18:54:12+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07821v1
Efficient and Compliant Control Framework for Versatile Human-Humanoid Collaborative Transportation,"We present a control framework that enables humanoid robots to perform collaborative transportation tasks with a human partner. The framework supports both translational and rotational motions, which are fundamental to co-transport scenarios. It comprises three components: a high-level planner, a low-level controller, and a stiffness modulation mechanism. At the planning level, we introduce the Interaction Linear Inverted Pendulum (I-LIP), which, combined with an admittance model and an MPC formulation, generates dynamically feasible footstep plans. These are executed by a QP-based whole-body controller that accounts for the coupled humanoid-object dynamics. Stiffness modulation regulates robot-object interaction, ensuring convergence to the desired relative configuration defined by the distance between the object and the robot's center of mass. We validate the effectiveness of the framework through real-world experiments conducted on the Digit humanoid platform. To quantify collaboration quality, we propose an efficiency metric that captures both task performance and inter-agent coordination. We show that this metric highlights the role of compliance in collaborative tasks and offers insights into desirable trajectory characteristics across both high- and low-level control layers. Finally, we showcase experimental results on collaborative behaviors, including translation, turning, and combined motions such as semi circular trajectories, representative of naturally occurring co-transportation tasks.",2025-12-08 18:52:10+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07819v1
Provable Long-Range Benefits of Next-Token Prediction,"Why do modern language models, trained to do well on next-word prediction, appear to generate coherent documents and capture long-range structure? Here we show that next-token prediction is provably powerful for learning longer-range structure, even with common neural network architectures. Specifically, we prove that optimizing next-token prediction over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) yields a model that closely approximates the training distribution: for held-out documents sampled from the training distribution, no algorithm of bounded description length limited to examining the next $k$ tokens, for any $k$, can distinguish between $k$ consecutive tokens of such documents and $k$ tokens generated by the learned language model following the same prefix. We provide polynomial bounds (in $k$, independent of the document length) on the model size needed to achieve such $k$-token indistinguishability, offering a complexity-theoretic explanation for the long-range coherence observed in practice.",2025-12-08 18:51:54+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07818v1
Understanding Privacy Risks in Code Models Through Training Dynamics: A Causal Approach,"Large language models for code (LLM4Code) have greatly improved developer productivity but also raise privacy concerns due to their reliance on open-source repositories containing abundant personally identifiable information (PII). Prior work shows that commercial models can reproduce sensitive PII, yet existing studies largely treat PII as a single category and overlook the heterogeneous risks among different types. We investigate whether distinct PII types vary in their likelihood of being learned and leaked by LLM4Code, and whether this relationship is causal. Our methodology includes building a dataset with diverse PII types, fine-tuning representative models of different scales, computing training dynamics on real PII data, and formulating a structural causal model to estimate the causal effect of learnability on leakage. Results show that leakage risks differ substantially across PII types and correlate with their training dynamics: easy-to-learn instances such as IP addresses exhibit higher leakage, while harder types such as keys and passwords leak less frequently. Ambiguous types show mixed behaviors. This work provides the first causal evidence that leakage risks are type-dependent and offers guidance for developing type-aware and learnability-aware defenses for LLM4Code.",2025-12-08 18:47:40+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CR']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07814v2
Inchworm-Inspired Soft Robot with Groove-Guided Locomotion,"Soft robots require directional control to navigate complex terrains. However, achieving such control often requires multiple actuators, which increases mechanical complexity, complicates control systems, and raises energy consumption. Here, we introduce an inchworm-inspired soft robot whose locomotion direction is controlled passively by patterned substrates. The robot employs a single rolled dielectric elastomer actuator, while groove patterns on a 3D-printed substrate guide its alignment and trajectory. Through systematic experiments, we demonstrate that varying groove angles enables precise control of locomotion direction without the need for complex actuation strategies. This groove-guided approach reduces energy consumption, simplifies robot design, and expands the applicability of bio-inspired soft robots in fields such as search and rescue, pipe inspection, and planetary exploration.",2025-12-08 18:47:04+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07813v1
Auditing Games for Sandbagging,"Future AI systems could conceal their capabilities ('sandbagging') during evaluations, potentially misleading developers and auditors. We stress-tested sandbagging detection techniques using an auditing game. First, a red team fine-tuned five models, some of which conditionally underperformed, as a proxy for sandbagging. Second, a blue team used black-box, model-internals, or training-based approaches to identify sandbagging models. We found that the blue team could not reliably discriminate sandbaggers from benign models. Black-box approaches were defeated by effective imitation of a weaker model. Linear probes, a model-internals approach, showed more promise but their naive application was vulnerable to behaviours instilled by the red team. We also explored capability elicitation as a strategy for detecting sandbagging. Although Prompt-based elicitation was not reliable, training-based elicitation consistently elicited full performance from the sandbagging models, using only a single correct demonstration of the evaluation task. However the performance of benign models was sometimes also raised, so relying on elicitation as a detection strategy was prone to false-positives. In the short-term, we recommend developers remove potential sandbagging using on-distribution training for elicitation. In the longer-term, further research is needed to ensure the efficacy of training-based elicitation, and develop robust methods for sandbagging detection. We open source our model organisms at https://github.com/AI-Safety-Institute/sandbagging_auditing_games and select transcripts and results at https://huggingface.co/datasets/sandbagging-games/evaluation_logs .

Group Representational Position Encoding,"We present GRAPE (Group RepresentAtional Position Encoding), a unified framework for positional encoding based on group actions. GRAPE brings together two families of mechanisms: (i) multiplicative rotations (Multiplicative GRAPE) in $\mathrm{SO}(d)$ and (ii) additive logit biases (Additive GRAPE) arising from unipotent actions in the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}$. In Multiplicative GRAPE, a position $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (or $t \in \mathbb{R}$) acts as $\mathbf{G}(n)=\exp(n\,ω\,\mathbf{L})$ with a rank-2 skew generator $\mathbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, yielding a relative, compositional, norm-preserving map with a closed-form matrix exponential. RoPE is recovered exactly when the $d/2$ planes are the canonical coordinate pairs with log-uniform spectrum. Learned commuting subspaces and compact non-commuting mixtures strictly extend this geometry to capture cross-subspace feature coupling at $O(d)$ and $O(r d)$ cost per head, respectively. In Additive GRAPE, additive logits arise as rank-1 (or low-rank) unipotent actions, recovering ALiBi and the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as exact special cases while preserving an exact relative law and streaming cacheability. Altogether, GRAPE supplies a principled design space for positional geometry in long-context models, subsuming RoPE and ALiBi as special cases.

Collaborative Causal Sensemaking: Closing the Complementarity Gap in Human-AI Decision Support,"LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for expert decision support, yet human-AI teams in high-stakes settings do not yet reliably outperform the best individual. We argue this complementarity gap reflects a fundamental mismatch: current agents are trained as answer engines, not as partners in the collaborative sensemaking through which experts actually make decisions. Sensemaking (the ability to co-construct causal explanations, surface uncertainties, and adapt goals) is the key capability that current training pipelines do not explicitly develop or evaluate. We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda to develop this capability from the ground up, spanning new training environments that reward collaborative thinking, representations for shared human-AI mental models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity. Taken together, these directions shift MAS research from building oracle-like answer engines to cultivating AI teammates that co-reason with their human partners over the causal structure of shared decisions, advancing the design of effective human-AI teams.",2025-12-08 18:30:41+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.HC', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07801v3
Large Causal Models from Large Language Models,"We introduce a new paradigm for building large causal models (LCMs) that exploits the enormous potential latent in today's large language models (LLMs). We describe our ongoing experiments with an implemented system called DEMOCRITUS (Decentralized Extraction of Manifold Ontologies of Causal Relations Integrating Topos Universal Slices) aimed at building, organizing, and visualizing LCMs that span disparate domains extracted from carefully targeted textual queries to LLMs. DEMOCRITUS is methodologically distinct from traditional narrow domain and hypothesis centered causal inference that builds causal models from experiments that produce numerical data. A high-quality LLM is used to propose topics, generate causal questions, and extract plausible causal statements from a diverse range of domains. The technical challenge is then to take these isolated, fragmented, potentially ambiguous and possibly conflicting causal claims, and weave them into a coherent whole, converting them into relational causal triples and embedding them into a LCM. Addressing this technical challenge required inventing new categorical machine learning methods, which we can only briefly summarize in this paper, as it is focused more on the systems side of building DEMOCRITUS. We describe the implementation pipeline for DEMOCRITUS comprising of six modules, examine its computational cost profile to determine where the current bottlenecks in scaling the system to larger models. We describe the results of using DEMOCRITUS over a wide range of domains, spanning archaeology, biology, climate change, economics, medicine and technology. We discuss the limitations of the current DEMOCRITUS system, and outline directions for extending its capabilities.",2025-12-08 18:28:04+00:00,['cs.AI'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07796v1
ReasonBENCH: Benchmarking the (In)Stability of LLM Reasoning,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where reasoning, such as multi-step problem solving and chain-of-thought, is essential. Yet, current evaluation practices overwhelmingly report single-run accuracy while ignoring the intrinsic uncertainty that naturally arises from stochastic decoding. This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting. Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability. Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs. Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability. Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques.

Automating High Energy Physics Data Analysis with LLM-Powered Agents,"We present a proof-of-principle study demonstrating the use of large language model (LLM) agents to automate a representative high energy physics (HEP) analysis. Using the Higgs boson diphoton cross-section measurement as a case study with ATLAS Open Data, we design a hybrid system that combines an LLM-based supervisor-coder agent with the Snakemake workflow manager. In this architecture, the workflow manager enforces reproducibility and determinism, while the agent autonomously generates, executes, and iteratively corrects analysis code in response to user instructions. We define quantitative evaluation metrics including success rate, error distribution, costs per specific task, and average number of API calls, to assess agent performance across multi-stage workflows. To characterize variability across architectures, we benchmark a representative selection of state-of-the-art LLMs spanning the Gemini and GPT-5 series, the Claude family, and leading open-weight models. While the workflow manager ensures deterministic execution of all analysis steps, the final outputs still show stochastic variation. Although we set the temperature to zero, other sampling parameters (e.g., top-p, top-k) remained at their defaults, and some reasoning-oriented models internally adjust these settings. Consequently, the models do not produce fully deterministic results. This study establishes the first LLM-agent-driven automated data-analysis framework in HEP, enabling systematic benchmarking of model capabilities, stability, and limitations in real-world scientific computing environments. The baseline code used in this work is available at https://huggingface.co/HWresearch/LLM4HEP.

OptMap: Geometric Map Distillation via Submodular Maximization,"Autonomous robots rely on geometric maps to inform a diverse set of perception and decision-making algorithms. As autonomy requires reasoning and planning on multiple scales of the environment, each algorithm may require a different map for optimal performance. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors generate an abundance of geometric data to satisfy these diverse requirements, but selecting informative, size-constrained maps is computationally challenging as it requires solving an NP-hard combinatorial optimization. In this work we present OptMap: a geometric map distillation algorithm which achieves real-time, application-specific map generation via multiple theoretical and algorithmic innovations. A central feature is the maximization of set functions that exhibit diminishing returns, i.e., submodularity, using polynomial-time algorithms with provably near-optimal solutions. We formulate a novel submodular reward function which quantifies informativeness, reduces input set sizes, and minimizes bias in sequentially collected datasets. Further, we propose a dynamically reordered streaming submodular algorithm which improves empirical solution quality and addresses input order bias via an online approximation of the value of all scans. Testing was conducted on open-source and custom datasets with an emphasis on long-duration mapping sessions, highlighting OptMap's minimal computation requirements.

"Toward Seamless Physical Human-Humanoid Interaction: Insights from Control, Intent, and Modeling with a Vision for What Comes Next","Physical Human-Humanoid Interaction (pHHI) is a rapidly advancing field with significant implications for deploying robots in unstructured, human-centric environments. In this review, we examine the current state of the art in pHHI through three core pillars: (i) humanoid modeling and control, (ii) human intent estimation, and (iii) computational human models. For each pillar, we survey representative approaches, identify open challenges, and analyze current limitations that hinder robust, scalable, and adaptive interaction. These include the need for whole-body control strategies capable of handling uncertain human dynamics, real-time intent inference under limited sensing, and modeling techniques that account for variability in human physical states. Although significant progress has been made within each domain, integration across pillars remains limited. We propose pathways for unifying methods across these areas to enable cohesive interaction frameworks. This structure enables us not only to map the current landscape but also to propose concrete directions for future research that aim to bridge these domains. Additionally, we introduce a unified taxonomy of interaction types based on modality, distinguishing between direct interactions (e.g., physical contact) and indirect interactions (e.g., object-mediated), and on the level of robot engagement, ranging from assistance to cooperation and collaboration. For each category in this taxonomy, we provide the three core pillars that highlight opportunities for cross-pillar unification. Our goal is to suggest avenues to advance robust, safe, and intuitive physical interaction, providing a roadmap for future research that will allow humanoid systems to effectively understand, anticipate, and collaborate with human partners in diverse real-world settings.",2025-12-08 17:47:19+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07765v1
RL-MTJail: Reinforcement Learning for Automated Black-Box Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models,"Large language models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, threatening their safe deployment in real-world applications. This paper studies black-box multi-turn jailbreaks, aiming to train attacker LLMs to elicit harmful content from black-box models through a sequence of prompt-output interactions. Existing approaches typically rely on single turn optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

UltrasODM: A Dual Stream Optical Flow Mamba Network for 3D Freehand Ultrasound Reconstruction,"Clinical ultrasound acquisition is highly operator-dependent, where rapid probe motion and brightness fluctuations often lead to reconstruction errors that reduce trust and clinical utility. We present UltrasODM, a dual-stream framework that assists sonographers during acquisition through calibrated per-frame uncertainty, saliency-based diagnostics, and actionable prompts. UltrasODM integrates (i) a contrastive ranking module that groups frames by motion similarity, (ii) an optical-flow stream fused with Dual-Mamba temporal modules for robust 6-DoF pose estimation, and (iii) a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) layer combining Bayesian uncertainty, clinician-calibrated thresholds, and saliency maps highlighting regions of low confidence. When uncertainty exceeds the threshold, the system issues unobtrusive alerts suggesting corrective actions such as re-scanning highlighted regions or slowing the sweep. Evaluated on a clinical freehand ultrasound dataset, UltrasODM reduces drift by 15.2%, distance error by 12.1%, and Hausdorff distance by 10.1% relative to UltrasOM, while producing per-frame uncertainty and saliency outputs.

SAVE: Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement for Mitigating Object Hallucination,"Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced substantially, they remain vulnerable to object hallucination caused by language priors and visual information loss. To address this, we propose SAVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement), a framework that mitigates hallucination by steering the model along Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) latent features. A binary object-presence question-answering probe identifies the SAE features most indicative of the model's visual information processing, referred to as visual understanding features. Steering the model along these identified features reinforces grounded visual understanding and effectively reduces hallucination. With its simple design, SAVE outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods on standard benchmarks, achieving a 10\%p improvement in CHAIR\_S and consistent gains on POPE and MMHal-Bench. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and layers confirm the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering along visual understanding features suppresses the generation of uncertain object tokens and increases attention to image tokens, mitigating hallucination.

Improving action classification with brain-inspired deep networks,"Action recognition is also key for applications ranging from robotics to healthcare monitoring. Action information can be extracted from the body pose and movements, as well as from the background scene. However, the extent to which deep neural networks (DNNs) make use of information about the body and information about the background remains unclear. Since these two sources of information may be correlated within a training dataset, DNNs might learn to rely predominantly on one of them, without taking full advantage of the other. Unlike DNNs, humans have domain-specific brain regions selective for perceiving bodies, and regions selective for perceiving scenes. The present work tests whether humans are thus more effective at extracting information from both body and background, and whether building brain-inspired deep network architectures with separate domain-specific streams for body and scene perception endows them with more human-like performance. We first demonstrate that DNNs trained using the HAA500 dataset perform almost as accurately on versions of the stimuli that show both body and background and on versions of the stimuli from which the body was removed, but are at chance-level for versions of the stimuli from which the background was removed. Conversely, human participants (N=28) can recognize the same set of actions accurately with all three versions of the stimuli, and perform significantly better on stimuli that show only the body than on stimuli that show only the background. Finally, we implement and test a novel architecture patterned after domain specificity in the brain with separate streams to process body and background information. We show that 1) this architecture improves action recognition performance, and 2) its accuracy across different versions of the stimuli follows a pattern that matches more closely the pattern of accuracy observed in human participants.",2025-12-08 17:19:47+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07729v1
The Native Spiking Microarchitecture: From Iontronic Primitives to Bit-Exact FP8 Arithmetic,"The 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and recent breakthroughs by Huanting Wang's team at Monash University establish angstrom-scale channels as promising post-silicon substrates with native integrate-and-fire (IF) dynamics. However, utilizing these stochastic, analog materials for deterministic, bit-exact AI workloads (e.g., FP8) remains a paradox. Existing neuromorphic methods often settle for approximation, failing Transformer precision standards. To traverse the gap ""from stochastic ions to deterministic floats,"" we propose a Native Spiking Microarchitecture. Treating noisy neurons as logic primitives, we introduce a Spatial Combinational Pipeline and a Sticky-Extra Correction mechanism. Validation across all 16,129 FP8 pairs confirms 100% bit-exact alignment with PyTorch. Crucially, our architecture reduces Linear layer latency to O(log N), yielding a 17x speedup.

Enabling Delayed-Full Charging Through Transformer-Based Real-Time-to-Departure Modeling for EV Battery Longevity,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are key to sustainable mobility, yet their lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) degrade more rapidly under prolonged high states of charge (SOC). This can be mitigated by delaying full charging \ours until just before departure, which requires accurate prediction of user departure times. In this work, we propose Transformer-based real-time-to-event (TTE) model for accurate EV departure prediction. Our approach represents each day as a TTE sequence by discretizing time into grid-based tokens.

Each Prompt Matters: Scaling Reinforcement Learning Without Wasting Rollouts on Hundred-Billion-Scale MoE,"We present CompassMax-V3-Thinking, a hundred-billion-scale MoE reasoning model trained with a new RL framework built on one principle: each prompt must matter. Scaling RL to this size exposes critical inefficiencies-zero-variance prompts that waste rollouts, unstable importance sampling over long horizons, advantage inversion from standard reward models, and systemic bottlenecks in rollout processing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce several unified innovations: (1) Multi-Stage Zero-Variance Elimination, which filters out non-informative prompts and stabilizes group-based policy optimization (e.g. GRPO) by removing wasted rollouts; (2) ESPO, an entropy-adaptive optimization method that balances token-level and sequence-level importance sampling to maintain stable learning dynamics; (3) a Router Replay strategy that aligns training-time MoE router decisions with inference-time behavior to mitigate train-infer discrepancies, coupled with a reward model adjustment to prevent advantage inversion; (4) a high-throughput RL system with FP8-precision rollouts, overlapped reward computation, and length-aware scheduling to eliminate performance bottlenecks. Together, these contributions form a cohesive pipeline that makes RL on hundred-billion-scale MoE models stable and efficient. The resulting model delivers strong performance across both internal and public evaluations.",2025-12-08 16:57:43+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07710v1
In-Context and Few-Shots Learning for Forecasting Time Series Data based on Large Language Models,"Existing data-driven approaches in modeling and predicting time series data include ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), Transformer-based models, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network). These approaches, and in particular deep learning-based models such as LSTM and TCN, have shown great results in predicting time series data. With the advancement of leveraging pre-trained foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and more notably Google's recent foundation model for time series data, {\it TimesFM} (Time Series Foundation Model), it is of interest to investigate whether these foundation models have the capability of outperforming existing modeling approaches in analyzing and predicting time series data.
  This paper investigates the performance of using LLM models for time series data prediction. We investigate the in-context learning methodology in the training of LLM models that are specific to the underlying application domain. More specifically, the paper explores training LLMs through in-context, zero-shot and few-shot learning and forecasting time series data with OpenAI {\tt o4-mini} and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, as well as the recent Google's Transformer-based TimesFM, a time series-specific foundation model, along with two deep learning models, namely TCN and LSTM networks. The findings indicate that TimesFM has the best overall performance with the lowest RMSE value (0.3023) and the competitive inference time (266 seconds). Furthermore, OpenAI's o4-mini also exhibits a good performance based on Zero Shot learning.
  These findings highlight pre-trained time series foundation models as a promising direction for real-time forecasting, enabling accurate and scalable deployment with minimal model adaptation.",2025-12-08 16:52:46+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07705v1
Demo: Generative AI helps Radiotherapy Planning with User Preference,"Radiotherapy planning is a highly complex process that often varies significantly across institutions and individual planners. Most existing deep learning approaches for 3D dose prediction rely on reference plans as ground truth during training, which can inadvertently bias models toward specific planning styles or institutional preferences. In this study, we introduce a novel generative model that predicts 3D dose distributions based solely on user-defined preference flavors. These customizable preferences enable planners to prioritize specific trade-offs between organs-at-risk (OARs) and planning target volumes (PTVs), offering greater flexibility and personalization. Designed for seamless integration with clinical treatment planning systems, our approach assists users in generating high-quality plans efficiently. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that our method can surpasses the Varian RapidPlan model in both adaptability and plan quality in some scenarios.",2025-12-08 16:49:21+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.08996v1
Guiding What Not to Generate: Automated Negative Prompting for Text-Image Alignment,"Despite substantial progress in text-to-image generation, achieving precise text-image alignment remains challenging, particularly for prompts with rich compositional structure or imaginative elements. To address this, we introduce Negative Prompting for Image Correction (NPC), an automated pipeline that improves alignment by identifying and applying negative prompts that suppress unintended content. We begin by analyzing cross-attention patterns to explain why both targeted negatives-those directly tied to the prompt's alignment error-and untargeted negatives-tokens unrelated to the prompt but present in the generated image-can enhance alignment. To discover useful negatives, NPC generates candidate prompts using a verifier-captioner-proposer framework and ranks them with a salient text-space score, enabling effective selection without requiring additional image synthesis. On GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench, NPC outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.571 vs. 0.371 on GenEval++ and the best overall performance on Imagine-Bench. By guiding what not to generate, NPC provides a principled, fully automated route to stronger text-image alignment in diffusion models.

sim2art: Accurate Articulated Object Modeling from a Single Video using Synthetic Training Data Only,"Understanding articulated objects is a fundamental challenge in robotics and digital twin creation. To effectively model such objects, it is essential to recover both part segmentation and the underlying joint parameters. Despite the importance of this task, previous work has largely focused on setups like multi-view systems, object scanning, or static cameras. In this paper, we present the first data-driven approach that jointly predicts part segmentation and joint parameters from monocular video captured with a freely moving camera. Trained solely on synthetic data, our method demonstrates strong generalization to real-world objects, offering a scalable and practical solution for articulated object understanding. Our approach operates directly on casually recorded video, making it suitable for real-time applications in dynamic environments.

Delay-Aware Diffusion Policy: Bridging the Observation-Execution Gap in Dynamic Tasks,"As a robot senses and selects actions, the world keeps changing. This inference delay creates a gap of tens to hundreds of milliseconds between the observed state and the state at execution. In this work, we take the natural generalization from zero delay to measured delay during training and inference. We introduce Delay-Aware Diffusion Policy (DA-DP), a framework for explicitly incorporating inference delays into policy learning. DA-DP corrects zero-delay trajectories to their delay-compensated counterparts, and augments the policy with delay conditioning. We empirically validate DA-DP on a variety of tasks, robots, and delays and find its success rate more robust to delay than delay-unaware methods. DA-DP is architecture agnostic and transfers beyond diffusion policies, offering a general pattern for delay-aware imitation learning. More broadly, DA-DP encourages evaluation protocols that report performance as a function of measured latency, not just task difficulty.",2025-12-08 16:38:14+00:00,"['cs.RO', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07697v1
When Large Language Models Do Not Work: Online Incivility Prediction through Graph Neural Networks,"Online incivility has emerged as a widespread and persistent problem in digital communities, imposing substantial social and psychological burdens on users. Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost. These findings highlight the crucial role of structural context in detecting online incivility and address the limitations of text-only LLM paradigms in behavioral prediction.

  Experiments demonstrate reliable gripping up to 90 degrees of body roll and inclination, while effective climbing on branches inclined up to 67.5 degrees, achieving a maximum speed of 0.55 body lengths per second on horizontal branches. The compliant tracks allow yaw steering of up to 10 degrees, enhancing maneuverability on irregular surfaces.
  Power measurements show efficient operation with a dimensionless cost of transport over an order of magnitude lower than typical hovering power consumption in aerial robots.

DIST-CLIP: Arbitrary Metadata and Image Guided MRI Harmonization via Disentangled Anatomy-Contrast Representations,"Deep learning holds immense promise for transforming medical image analysis, yet its clinical generalization remains profoundly limited. A major barrier is data heterogeneity. This is particularly true in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, where scanner hardware differences, diverse acquisition protocols, and varying sequence parameters introduce substantial domain shifts that obscure underlying biological signals. Data harmonization methods aim to reduce these instrumental and acquisition variability, but existing approaches remain insufficient. When applied to imaging data, image-based harmonization approaches are often restricted by the need for target images, while existing text-guided methods rely on simplistic labels that fail to capture complex acquisition details or are typically restricted to datasets with limited variability, failing to capture the heterogeneity of real-world clinical environments. To address these limitations, we propose DIST-CLIP (Disentangled Style Transfer with CLIP Guidance), a unified framework for MRI harmonization that flexibly uses either target images or DICOM metadata for guidance. Our framework explicitly disentangles anatomical content from image contrast, with the contrast representations being extracted using pre-trained CLIP encoders. These contrast embeddings are then integrated into the anatomical content via a novel Adaptive Style Transfer module. We trained and evaluated DIST-CLIP on diverse real-world clinical datasets, and showed significant improvements in performance when compared against state-of-the-art methods in both style translation fidelity and anatomical preservation, offering a flexible solution for style transfer and standardizing MRI data. Our code and weights will be made publicly available upon publication.",2025-12-08 16:09:10+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07674v1
Multi-Domain Motion Embedding: Expressive Real-Time Mimicry for Legged Robots,"Effective motion representation is crucial for enabling robots to imitate expressive behaviors in real time, yet existing motion controllers often ignore inherent patterns in motion. Previous efforts in representation learning do not attempt to jointly capture structured periodic patterns and irregular variations in human and animal movement. To address this, we present Multi-Domain Motion Embedding (MDME), a motion representation that unifies the embedding of structured and unstructured features using a wavelet-based encoder and a probabilistic embedding in parallel. This produces a rich representation of reference motions from a minimal input set, enabling improved generalization across diverse motion styles and morphologies. We evaluate MDME on retargeting-free real-time motion imitation by conditioning robot control policies on the learned embeddings, demonstrating accurate reproduction of complex trajectories on both humanoid and quadruped platforms. Our comparative studies confirm that MDME outperforms prior approaches in reconstruction fidelity and generalizability to unseen motions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MDME can reproduce novel motion styles in real-time through zero-shot deployment, eliminating the need for task-specific tuning or online retargeting. These results position MDME as a generalizable and structure-aware foundation for scalable real-time robot imitation.",2025-12-08 16:07:19+00:00,['cs.RO'],https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07673v1
DeepCode: Open Agentic Coding,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have given rise to powerful coding agents, making it possible for code assistants to evolve into code engineers. However, existing methods still face significant challenges in achieving high-fidelity document-to-codebase synthesis--such as scientific papers to code--primarily due to a fundamental conflict between information overload and the context bottlenecks of LLMs. In this work, we introduce DeepCode, a fully autonomous framework that fundamentally addresses this challenge through principled information-flow management. By treating repository synthesis as a channel optimization problem, DeepCode seamlessly orchestrates four information operations to maximize task-relevant signals under finite context budgets: source compression via blueprint distillation, structured indexing using stateful code memory, conditional knowledge injection via retrieval-augmented generation, and closed-loop error correction. Extensive evaluations on the PaperBench benchmark demonstrate that DeepCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, decisively outperforming leading commercial agents such as Cursor and Claude Code, and crucially, surpassing PhD-level human experts from top institutes on key reproduction metrics. By systematically transforming paper specifications into production-grade implementations comparable to human expert quality, this work establishes new foundations for autonomous scientific reproduction that can accelerate research evaluation and discovery.",2025-12-08 16:07:13+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07921v1

This paper presents an innovative AI-powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system designed to overcome these limitations by automating underwater object detection, analysis, and reporting. The system integrates YOLOv12 Nano for real-time object detection, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (ResNet50) for feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means++ clustering for grouping marine objects based on visual characteristics. Furthermore, a Large Language Model (LLM) (GPT-4o Mini) is employed to generate structured reports and summaries of underwater findings, enhancing data interpretation. The system was trained and evaluated on a combined dataset of over 55,000 images from the DeepFish and OzFish datasets, capturing diverse Australian marine environments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability to detect marine objects with a mAP@0.5 of 0.512, a precision of 0.535, and a recall of 0.438. The integration of PCA effectively reduced feature dimensionality while preserving 98% variance, facilitating K-Means clustering which successfully grouped detected objects based on visual similarities. The LLM integration proved effective in generating insightful summaries of detections and clusters, supported by location data. This integrated approach significantly reduces the risks associated with human diving, increases mission efficiency, and enhances the speed and depth of underwater data analysis, paving the way for more effective scientific research and discovery in challenging marine environments.",2025-12-08 15:45:40+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07652v1
A Mathematical Theory of Top-$k$ Sparse Attention via Total Variation Distance,"We develop a unified mathematical framework for certified Top-$k$ attention truncation that quantifies approximation error at both the distribution and output levels. For a single attention distribution $P$ and its Top-$k$ truncation $\hat P$, we show that the total-variation distance coincides with the discarded softmax tail mass and satisfies $\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)=1-e^{-\mathrm{KL}(\hat P\Vert P)}$, yielding sharp Top-$k$-specific bounds in place of generic inequalities. From this we derive non-asymptotic deterministic bounds -- from a single boundary gap through multi-gap and blockwise variants -- that control $\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)$ using only the ordered logits. Using an exact head-tail decomposition, we prove that the output error factorizes as $\|\mathrm{Attn}(q,K,V)-\mathrm{Attn}_k(q,K,V)\|_2=τ\|μ_{\mathrm{tail}}-μ_{\mathrm{head}}\|_2$ with $τ=\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)$, yielding a new head-tail diameter bound $\|\mathrm{Attn}(q,K,V)-\mathrm{Attn}_k(q,K,V)\|_2\leτ\,\mathrm{diam}_{H,T}$ and refinements linking the error to $\mathrm{Var}_P(V)$. Under an i.i.d. Gaussian score model $s_i\sim\mathcal N(μ,σ^2)$ we derive closed-form tail masses and an asymptotic rule for the minimal $k_\varepsilon$ ensuring $\mathrm{TV}(P,\hat P)\le\varepsilon$, namely $k_\varepsilon/n\approxΦ_c(σ+Φ^{-1}(\varepsilon))$. Experiments on bert-base-uncased and synthetic logits confirm the predicted scaling of $k_\varepsilon/n$ and show that certified Top-$k$ can reduce scored keys by 2-4$\times$ on average while meeting the prescribed total-variation budget.",2025-12-08 15:36:41+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07647v1
The Agent Capability Problem: Predicting Solvability Through Information-Theoretic Bounds,"When should an autonomous agent commit resources to a task? We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints. Rather than relying on empirical heuristics, ACP frames problem-solving as information acquisition: an agent requires $\Itotal$ bits to identify a solution and gains $\Istep$ bits per action at cost $\Cstep$, yielding an effective cost $\Ceff = (\Itotal/\Istep), \Cstep$ that predicts resource requirements before search. We prove that $\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies. The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \",2025-12-08 15:21:52+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.CC', 'cs.IT', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07631v1
Incorporating Structure and Chord Constraints in Symbolic Transformer-based Melodic Harmonization,"Transformer architectures offer significant advantages regarding the generation of symbolic music; their capabilities for incorporating user preferences toward what they generate is being studied under many aspects. This paper studies the inclusion of predefined chord constraints in melodic harmonization, i.e., where a desired chord at a specific location is provided along with the melody as inputs and the autoregressive transformer model needs to incorporate the chord in the harmonization that it generates. The peculiarities of involving such constraints is discussed and an algorithm is proposed for tackling this task. This algorithm is called B* and it combines aspects of beam search and A* along with backtracking to force pretrained transformers to satisfy the chord constraints, at the correct onset position within the correct bar. The algorithm is brute-force and has exponential complexity in the worst case; however, this paper is a first attempt to highlight the difficulties of the problem and proposes an algorithm that offers many possibilities for improvements since it accommodates the involvement of heuristics.",2025-12-08 15:16:33+00:00,"['cs.SD', 'cs.AI', 'cs.SC']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07627v1
Time Series Foundation Models for Process Model Forecasting,"Process Model Forecasting (PMF) aims to predict how the control-flow structure of a process evolves over time by modeling the temporal dynamics of directly-follows (DF) relations, complementing predictive process monitoring that focuses on single-case prefixes. Prior benchmarks show that machine learning and deep learning models provide only modest gains over statistical baselines, mainly due to the sparsity and heterogeneity of the DF time series. We investigate Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), large pre-trained models for generic time series, as an alternative for PMF. Using DF time series derived from real-life event logs, we compare zero-shot use of TSFMs, without additional training, with fine-tuned variants adapted on PMF-specific data. TSFMs generally achieve lower forecasting errors (MAE and RMSE) than traditional and specialized models trained from scratch on the same logs, indicating effective transfer of temporal structure from non-process domains. While fine-tuning can further improve accuracy, the gains are often small and may disappear on smaller or more complex datasets, so zero-shot use remains a strong default. Our study highlights the generalization capability and data efficiency of TSFMs for process-related time series and, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first systematic evaluation of temporal foundation models for PMF.",2025-12-08 15:08:50+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07624v1

Across all tasks, RL-trained models outperform their corresponding base models, although the degree of improvement differs by benchmark.
  Our parametric analysis offers practical guidance for RL-based LLM training. Increasing the group size in GRPO and DAPO leads to more stable training dynamics and higher accuracy, while the impact of the KL-penalty coefficient is non-monotonic.

Obstacle Avoidance of UAV in Dynamic Environments Using Direction and Velocity-Adaptive Artificial Potential Field,"The conventional Artificial Potential Field (APF) is fundamentally limited by the local minima issue and its inability to account for the kinematics of moving obstacles. This paper addresses the critical challenge of autonomous collision avoidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic and cluttered airspace by proposing a novel Direction and Relative Velocity Weighted Artificial Potential Field (APF). In this approach, a bounded weighting function, $ω(θ,v_{e})$, is introduced to dynamically scale the repulsive potential based on the direction and velocity of the obstacle relative to the UAV. This robust APF formulation is integrated within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to generate collision-free trajectories while adhering to kinematic constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively resolves local minima and significantly enhances safety by enabling smooth, predictive avoidance maneuvers.

To promote {individual fairness}~--~treating similar instances similarly~--~we compute question similarity using NLP embeddings and solve items in \emph{joint pairs of similar questions} rather than in isolation. The prompt enforces a global decision protocol: extract decisive clinical features, map each \((\text{question}, \text{option})\) to a score $f(x)$ that acts as confidence, and impose a Lipschitz-style constraint so that similar inputs receive similar scores and, hence, consistent outputs.

"More than Segmentation: Benchmarking SAM 3 for Segmentation, 3D Perception, and Reconstruction in Robotic Surgery","The recent SAM 3 and SAM 3D have introduced significant advancements over the predecessor, SAM 2, particularly with the integration of language-based segmentation and enhanced 3D perception capabilities. SAM 3 supports zero-shot segmentation across a wide range of prompts, including point, bounding box, and language-based prompts, allowing for more flexible and intuitive interactions with the model. In this empirical evaluation, we assess the performance of SAM 3 in robot-assisted surgery, benchmarking its zero-shot segmentation with point and bounding box prompts and exploring its effectiveness in dynamic video tracking, alongside its newly introduced language prompt segmentation.

"See Once, Then Act: Vision-Language-Action Model with Task Learning from One-Shot Video Demonstrations","Developing robust and general-purpose manipulation policies represents a fundamental objective in robotics research. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated promising capabilities for end-to-end robot control, existing approaches still exhibit limited generalization to tasks beyond their training distributions. In contrast, humans possess remarkable proficiency in acquiring novel skills by simply observing others performing them once. Inspired by this capability, we propose ViVLA, a generalist robotic manipulation policy that achieves efficient task learning from a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach jointly processes an expert demonstration video alongside the robot's visual observations to predict both the demonstrated action sequences and subsequent robot actions, effectively distilling fine-grained manipulation knowledge from expert behavior and transferring it seamlessly to the agent. To enhance the performance of ViVLA, we develop a scalable expert-agent pair data generation pipeline capable of synthesizing paired trajectories from easily accessible human videos, further augmented by curated pairs from publicly available datasets. This pipeline produces a total of 892,911 expert-agent samples for training ViVLA. Experimental results demonstrate that our ViVLA is able to acquire novel manipulation skills from only a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach achieves over 30% improvement on unseen LIBERO tasks and maintains above 35% gains with cross-embodiment videos.

R2MF-Net: A Recurrent Residual Multi-Path Fusion Network for Robust Multi-directional Spine X-ray Segmentation,"Accurate segmentation of spinal structures in X-ray images is a prerequisite for quantitative scoliosis assessment, including Cobb angle measurement, vertebral translation estimation and curvature classification. In routine practice, clinicians acquire coronal, left-bending and right-bending radiographs to jointly evaluate deformity severity and spinal flexibility. However, the segmentation step remains heavily manual, time-consuming and non-reproducible, particularly in low-contrast images and in the presence of rib shadows or overlapping tissues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes R2MF-Net, a recurrent residual multi-path encoder--decoder network tailored for automatic segmentation of multi-directional spine X-ray images. The overall design consists of a coarse segmentation network and a fine segmentation network connected in cascade. Both stages adopt an improved Inception-style multi-branch feature extractor, while a recurrent residual jump connection (R2-Jump) module is inserted into skip paths to gradually align encoder and decoder semantics. A multi-scale cross-stage skip (MC-Skip) mechanism allows the fine network to reuse hierarchical representations from multiple decoder levels of the coarse network, thereby strengthening the stability of segmentation across imaging directions and contrast conditions. Furthermore, a lightweight spatial-channel squeeze-and-excitation block (SCSE-Lite) is employed at the bottleneck to emphasize spine-related activations and suppress irrelevant structures and background noise. We evaluate R2MF-Net on a clinical multi-view radiograph dataset comprising 228 sets of coronal, left-bending and right-bending spine X-ray images with expert annotations.",2025-12-08 14:12:52+00:00,"['eess.IV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07576v1

We propose Weighted Contrastive Adaptation (WECA), a Weighted contrastive objective that aligns normal and anomaly-augmented representations, preserving anomaly-relevant information while maintaining consistency under benign variations. Evaluations on a nationwide ATM transaction dataset with domain-informed anomaly injection show that WECA improves SMAPE on anomaly-affected data by 6.1 percentage points compared to a normally trained baseline, with negligible degradation on normal data. These results demonstrate that WECA enhances forecasting reliability under anomalies without sacrificing performance during regular operations.",2025-12-08 14:02:31+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07569v1
Dual-Stream Cross-Modal Representation Learning via Residual Semantic Decorrelation,"Cross-modal learning has become a fundamental paradigm for integrating heterogeneous information sources such as images, text, and structured attributes. However, multimodal representations often suffer from modality dominance, redundant information coupling, and spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal generalization and limited interpretability. In particular, high-variance modalities tend to overshadow weaker but semantically important signals, while naïve fusion strategies entangle modality-shared and modality-specific factors in an uncontrolled manner. This makes it difficult to understand which modality actually drives a prediction and to maintain robustness when some modalities are noisy or missing. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Residual Semantic Decorrelation Network (DSRSD-Net), a simple yet effective framework that disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared information through residual decomposition and explicit semantic decorrelation constraints. DSRSD-Net introduces: (1) a dual-stream representation learning module that separates intra-modal (private) and inter-modal (shared) latent factors via residual projection; (2) a residual semantic alignment head that maps shared factors from different modalities into a common space using a combination of contrastive and regression-style objectives; and (3) a decorrelation and orthogonality loss that regularizes the covariance structure of the shared space while enforcing orthogonality between shared and private streams, thereby suppressing cross-modal redundancy and preventing feature collapse. Experimental results on two large-scale educational benchmarks demonstrate that DSRSD-Net consistently improves next-step prediction and final outcome prediction over strong single-modality, early-fusion, late-fusion, and co-attention baselines.",2025-12-08 14:01:16+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'eess.IV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07568v1
Toward More Reliable Artificial Intelligence: Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models,"Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content plausible but incorrect claims about image content. We propose a training-free self-correction framework enabling VLMs to iteratively refine responses through uncertainty-guided visual re-attention. Our method combines multidimensional uncertainty quantification (token entropy, attention dispersion, semantic consistency, claim confidence) with attention-guided cropping of under-explored regions. Operating entirely with frozen, pretrained VLMs, our framework requires no gradient updates. We validate our approach on the POPE and MMHAL BENCH benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23] architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces hallucination rates by 9.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, while improving object existence accuracy by 4.7 points on adversarial splits. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms that uncertainty-guided re-attention successfully grounds corrections in visual evidence where standard decoding fails. We validate our approach on Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23], with plans to extend validation across diverse architectures in future versions. We release our code and methodology to facilitate future research in trustworthy multimodal systems.",2025-12-08 13:58:46+00:00,"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CL', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07564v1
MoCoRP: Modeling Consistent Relations between Persona and Response for Persona-based Dialogue,"As dialogue systems become increasingly important across various domains, a key challenge in persona-based dialogue is generating engaging and context-specific interactions while ensuring the model acts with a coherent personality. However, existing persona-based dialogue datasets lack explicit relations between persona sentences and responses, which makes it difficult for models to effectively capture persona information. To address these issues, we propose MoCoRP (Modeling Consistent Relations between Persona and Response), a framework that incorporates explicit relations into language models. MoCoRP leverages an NLI expert to explicitly extract the NLI relations between persona sentences and responses, enabling the model to effectively incorporate appropriate persona information from the context into its responses. We applied this framework to pre-trained models like BART and further extended it to modern large language models (LLMs) through alignment tuning. Experimental results on the public datasets ConvAI2 and MPChat demonstrate that MoCoRP outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior persona consistency and engaging, context-aware dialogue generation. Furthermore, our model not only excels in quantitative metrics but also shows significant improvements in qualitative aspects. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling persona-response relations in persona-based dialogue.

Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding for Error Span Detection in Reference-Free Automatic Machine Translation Evaluation,"Error Span Detection (ESD) is a subtask of automatic machine translation evaluation that localizes error spans in translations and labels their severity. State-of-the-art generative ESD methods typically decode using Maximum a Posteriori (MAP), assuming that model-estimated probabilities are perfectly correlated with similarity to human annotation. However, we observed that annotations dissimilar to the human annotation could achieve a higher model likelihood than the human annotation. We address this issue by applying Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to generative ESD models. Specifically, we employ sentence- and span-level similarity metrics as utility functions to select candidate hypotheses based on their approximate similarity to the human annotation. Extensive experimental results show that our MBR decoding outperforms the MAP baseline at the system, sentence, and span-levels. Furthermore, to mitigate the computational cost of MBR decoding, we demonstrate that applying MBR distillation enables a standard greedy model to match MBR decoding performance, effectively eliminating the inference-time latency bottleneck.",2025-12-08 13:21:44+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07540v1
VulnLLM-R: Specialized Reasoning LLM with Agent Scaffold for Vulnerability Detection,"We propose VulnLLM-R, the~\emph{first specialized reasoning LLM} for vulnerability detection. Our key insight is that LLMs can reason about program states and analyze the potential vulnerabilities, rather than simple pattern matching. This can improve the model's generalizability and prevent learning shortcuts. However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories. This work represents a pioneering effort to enable real-world, project-level vulnerability detection using AI agents powered by specialized reasoning models. The code is available at~\href{https://github.com/ucsb-mlsec/VulnLLM-R}{github}.",2025-12-08 13:06:23+00:00,"['cs.CR', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07533v1
Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Under Confounding,"We investigate model-based reinforcement learning in contextual Markov decision processes (C-MDPs) in which the context is unobserved and induces confounding in the offline dataset. In such settings, conventional model-learning methods are fundamentally inconsistent, as the transition and reward mechanisms generated under a behavioral policy do not correspond to the interventional quantities required for evaluating a state-based policy. To address this issue, we adapt a proximal off-policy evaluation approach that identifies the confounded reward expectation using only observable state-action-reward trajectories under mild invertibility conditions on proxy variables. When combined with a behavior-averaged transition model, this construction yields a surrogate MDP whose Bellman operator is well defined and consistent for state-based policies, and which integrates seamlessly with the maximum causal entropy (MaxCausalEnt) model-learning framework. The proposed formulation enables principled model learning and planning in confounded environments where contextual information is unobserved, unavailable, or impractical to collect.",2025-12-08 13:02:00+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07528v1
LIME: Making LLM Data More Efficient with Linguistic Metadata Embeddings,"Pre-training decoder-only language models relies on vast amounts of high-quality data, yet the availability of such data is increasingly reaching its limits. While metadata is commonly used to create and curate these datasets, its potential as a direct training signal remains under-explored. We challenge this status quo and propose LIME (Linguistic Metadata Embeddings), a method that enriches token embeddings with metadata capturing syntax, semantics, and contextual properties. LIME substantially improves pre-training efficiency. Specifically, it adapts up to 56% faster to the training data distribution, while introducing only 0.01% additional parameters at negligible compute overhead. Beyond efficiency, LIME improves tokenization, leading to remarkably stronger language modeling capabilities and generative task performance. These benefits persist across model scales (500M to 2B). In addition, we develop a variant with shifted metadata, LIME+1, that can guide token generation. Given prior metadata for the next token, LIME+1 improves reasoning performance by up to 38% and arithmetic accuracy by up to 35%.",2025-12-08 12:59:24+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07522v1
SPAD: Seven-Source Token Probability Attribution with Syntactic Aggregation for Detecting Hallucinations in RAG,"Detecting hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remains a challenge. Prior approaches attribute hallucinations to a binary conflict between internal knowledge (stored in FFNs) and retrieved context. However, this perspective is incomplete, failing to account for the impact of other components in the generative process, such as the user query, previously generated tokens, the current token itself, and the final LayerNorm adjustment. To address this, we introduce SPAD. First, we mathematically attribute each token's probability into seven distinct sources: Query, RAG, Past, Current Token, FFN, Final LayerNorm, and Initial Embedding. This attribution quantifies how each source contributes to the generation of the current token. Then, we aggregate these scores by POS tags to quantify how different components drive specific linguistic categories. By identifying anomalies, such as Nouns relying on Final LayerNorm, SPAD effectively detects hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPAD achieves state-of-the-art performance",2025-12-08 12:50:41+00:00,"['cs.CL', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07515v1
Exploring possible vector systems for faster training of neural networks with preconfigured latent spaces,"The overall neural network (NN) performance is closely related to the properties of its embedding distribution in latent space (LS). It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings.",2025-12-08 12:46:39+00:00,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07509v2
VP-AutoTest: A Virtual-Physical Fusion Autonomous Driving Testing Platform,"The rapid development of autonomous vehicles has led to a surge in testing demand. Traditional testing methods, such as virtual simulation, closed-course, and public road testing, face several challenges, including unrealistic vehicle states, limited testing capabilities, and high costs. These issues have prompted increasing interest in virtual-physical fusion testing. However, despite its potential, virtual-physical fusion testing still faces challenges, such as limited element types, narrow testing scope, and fixed evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose the Virtual-Physical Testing Platform for Autonomous Vehicles (VP-AutoTest), which integrates over ten types of virtual and physical elements, including vehicles, pedestrians, and roadside infrastructure, to replicate the diversity of real-world traffic participants. The platform also supports both single-vehicle interaction and multi-vehicle cooperation testing, employing adversarial testing and parallel deduction to accelerate fault detection and explore algorithmic limits, while OBU and Redis communication enable seamless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperation across all levels of cooperative automation. Furthermore, VP-AutoTest incorporates a multidimensional evaluation framework and AI-driven expert systems to conduct comprehensive performance assessment and defect diagnosis. Finally, by comparing virtual-physical fusion test results with real-world experiments, the platform performs credibility self-evaluation to ensure both the fidelity and efficiency of autonomous driving testing.

AutoICE: Automatically Synthesizing Verifiable C Code via LLM-driven Evolution,"Automatically synthesizing verifiable code from natural language requirements ensures software correctness and reliability while significantly lowering the barrier to adopting the techniques of formal methods. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), long-standing efforts at autoformalization have gained new momentum. However, existing approaches suffer from severe syntactic and semantic errors due to the scarcity of domain-specific pre-training corpora and often fail to formalize implicit knowledge effectively. In this paper, we propose AutoICE, an LLM-driven evolutionary search for synthesizing verifiable C code. It introduces the diverse individual initialization and the collaborative crossover to enable diverse iterative updates, thereby mitigating error propagation inherent in single-agent iterations. Besides, it employs the self-reflective mutation to facilitate the discovery of implicit knowledge. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoICE: it successfully verifies $90.36$\% of code, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. Besides, on a developer-friendly dataset variant, AutoICE achieves a $88.33$\% verification success rate, significantly surpassing the $65$\% success rate of the SOTA approach.",2025-12-08 12:35:10+00:00,"['cs.SE', 'cs.AI']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07501v1
How Do LLMs Fail In Agentic Scenarios? A Qualitative Analysis of Success and Failure Scenarios of Various LLMs in Agentic Simulations,"We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when operating as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities. Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data.",2025-12-08 12:27:15+00:00,"['cs.AI', 'cs.SE']",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07497v2
